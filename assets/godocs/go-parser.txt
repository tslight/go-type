package parser // import "go/parser"

Package parser implements a parser for Go source files.

The ParseFile function reads file input from a string, []byte, or io.Reader, and
produces an ast.File representing the complete abstract syntax tree of the file.

The ParseExprFrom function reads a single source-level expression and produces
an ast.Expr, the syntax tree of the expression.

The parser accepts a larger language than is syntactically permitted by the Go
spec, for simplicity, and for improved robustness in the presence of syntax
errors. For instance, in method declarations, the receiver is treated like
an ordinary parameter list and thus may contain multiple entries where the
spec permits exactly one. Consequently, the corresponding field in the AST
(ast.FuncDecl.Recv) field is not restricted to one entry.

Applications that need to parse one or more complete packages of Go source code
may find it more convenient not to interact directly with the parser but instead
to use the Load function in package golang.org/x/tools/go/packages.

FUNCTIONS

func ParseDir(fset *token.FileSet, path string, filter func(fs.FileInfo) bool, mode Mode) (pkgs map[string]*ast.Package, first error)
    ParseDir calls ParseFile for all files with names ending in ".go" in the
    directory specified by path and returns a map of package name -> package AST
    with all the packages found.

    If filter != nil, only the files with fs.FileInfo entries passing through
    the filter (and ending in ".go") are considered. The mode bits are passed
    to ParseFile unchanged. Position information is recorded in fset, which must
    not be nil.

    If the directory couldn't be read, a nil map and the respective error are
    returned. If a parse error occurred, a non-nil but incomplete map and the
    first error encountered are returned.

    Deprecated: ParseDir does not consider build tags when associating files
    with packages. For precise information about the relationship between
    packages and files, use golang.org/x/tools/go/packages, which can also
    optionally parse and type-check the files too.

func ParseExpr(x string) (ast.Expr, error)
    ParseExpr is a convenience function for obtaining the AST of an expression
    x. The position information recorded in the AST is undefined. The filename
    used in error messages is the empty string.

    If syntax errors were found, the result is a partial AST (with ast.Bad*
    nodes representing the fragments of erroneous source code). Multiple errors
    are returned via a scanner.ErrorList which is sorted by source position.

func ParseExprFrom(fset *token.FileSet, filename string, src any, mode Mode) (expr ast.Expr, err error)
    ParseExprFrom is a convenience function for parsing an expression.
    The arguments have the same meaning as for ParseFile, but the source must be
    a valid Go (type or value) expression. Specifically, fset must not be nil.

    If the source couldn't be read, the returned AST is nil and the error
    indicates the specific failure. If the source was read but syntax errors
    were found, the result is a partial AST (with ast.Bad* nodes representing
    the fragments of erroneous source code). Multiple errors are returned via a
    scanner.ErrorList which is sorted by source position.

func ParseFile(fset *token.FileSet, filename string, src any, mode Mode) (f *ast.File, err error)
    ParseFile parses the source code of a single Go source file and returns
    the corresponding ast.File node. The source code may be provided via the
    filename of the source file, or via the src parameter.

    If src != nil, ParseFile parses the source from src and the filename is
    only used when recording position information. The type of the argument
    for the src parameter must be string, []byte, or io.Reader. If src == nil,
    ParseFile parses the file specified by filename.

    The mode parameter controls the amount of source text parsed and other
    optional parser functionality. If the SkipObjectResolution mode bit is set
    (recommended), the object resolution phase of parsing will be skipped,
    causing File.Scope, File.Unresolved, and all Ident.Obj fields to be nil.
    Those fields are deprecated; see ast.Object for details.

    Position information is recorded in the file set fset, which must not be
    nil.

    If the source couldn't be read, the returned AST is nil and the error
    indicates the specific failure. If the source was read but syntax errors
    were found, the result is a partial AST (with ast.Bad* nodes representing
    the fragments of erroneous source code). Multiple errors are returned via a
    scanner.ErrorList which is sorted by source position.


TYPES

type Mode uint
    A Mode value is a set of flags (or 0). They control the amount of source
    code parsed and other optional parser functionality.

const (
	PackageClauseOnly    Mode             = 1 << iota // stop parsing after package clause
	ImportsOnly                                       // stop parsing after import declarations
	ParseComments                                     // parse comments and add them to AST
	Trace                                             // print a trace of parsed productions
	DeclarationErrors                                 // report declaration errors
	SpuriousErrors                                    // same as AllErrors, for backward-compatibility
	SkipObjectResolution                              // skip deprecated identifier resolution; see ParseFile
	AllErrors            = SpuriousErrors             // report all errors (not just the first 10 on different lines)
)
