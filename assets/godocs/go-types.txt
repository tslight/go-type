package types // import "go/types"

Package types declares the data types and implements the algorithms for
type-checking of Go packages. Use Config.Check to invoke the type checker for a
package. Alternatively, create a new type checker with NewChecker and invoke it
incrementally by calling Checker.Files.

Type-checking consists of several interdependent phases:

Name resolution maps each identifier (ast.Ident) in the program to the symbol
(Object) it denotes. Use the Defs and Uses fields of Info or the Info.ObjectOf
method to find the symbol for an identifier, and use the Implicits field of Info
to find the symbol for certain other kinds of syntax node.

Constant folding computes the exact constant value (constant.Value) of every
expression (ast.Expr) that is a compile-time constant. Use the Types field of
Info to find the results of constant folding for an expression.

Type deduction computes the type (Type) of every expression (ast.Expr) and
checks for compliance with the language specification. Use the Types field of
Info for the results of type deduction.

Applications that need to type-check one or more complete packages of Go source
code may find it more convenient not to invoke the type checker directly but
instead to use the Load function in package golang.org/x/tools/go/packages.

    Typ contains the predeclared *Basic types indexed by their corresponding
    BasicKind.

    The *Basic type for Typ[Byte] will have the name "uint8". Use
    Universe.Lookup("byte").Type() to obtain the specific alias basic type named
    "byte" (and analogous for "rune").


FUNCTIONS

func AssertableTo(V *Interface, T Type) bool
    AssertableTo reports whether a value of type V can be asserted to have type
    T.

    The behavior of AssertableTo is unspecified in three cases:
      - if T is Typ[Invalid]
      - if V is a generalized interface; i.e., an interface that may only be
        used as a type constraint in Go code
      - if T is an uninstantiated generic type

func AssignableTo(V, T Type) bool
    AssignableTo reports whether a value of type V is assignable to a variable
    of type T.

    The behavior of AssignableTo is unspecified if V or T is Typ[Invalid] or an
    uninstantiated generic type.

func CheckExpr(fset *token.FileSet, pkg *Package, pos token.Pos, expr ast.Expr, info *Info) (err error)
    CheckExpr type checks the expression expr as if it had appeared at position
    pos of package pkg. Type information about the expression is recorded in
    info. The expression may be an identifier denoting an uninstantiated generic
    function or type.

    If pkg == nil, the Universe scope is used and the provided position pos
    is ignored. If pkg != nil, and pos is invalid, the package scope is used.
    Otherwise, pos must belong to the package.

    An error is returned if pos is not within the package or if the node cannot
    be type-checked.

    Note: Eval and CheckExpr should not be used instead of running Check to
    compute types and values, but in addition to Check, as these functions
    ignore the context in which an expression is used (e.g., an assignment).
    Thus, top-level untyped constants will return an untyped type rather than
    the respective context-specific type.

func Comparable(T Type) bool
    Comparable reports whether values of type T are comparable.

func ConvertibleTo(V, T Type) bool
    ConvertibleTo reports whether a value of type V is convertible to a value of
    type T.

    The behavior of ConvertibleTo is unspecified if V or T is Typ[Invalid] or an
    uninstantiated generic type.

func DefPredeclaredTestFuncs()
    DefPredeclaredTestFuncs defines the assert and trace built-ins. These
    built-ins are intended for debugging and testing of this package only.

func ExprString(x ast.Expr) string
    ExprString returns the (possibly shortened) string representation for x.
    Shortened representations are suitable for user interfaces but may not
    necessarily follow Go syntax.

func Id(pkg *Package, name string) string
    Id returns name if it is exported, otherwise it returns the name qualified
    with the package path.

func Identical(x, y Type) bool
    Identical reports whether x and y are identical types. Receivers of
    Signature types are ignored.

    Predicates such as Identical, Implements, and Satisfies assume that both
    operands belong to a consistent collection of symbols (Object values). For
    example, two Named types can be identical only if their Named.Obj methods
    return the same TypeName symbol. A collection of symbols is consistent if,
    for each logical package whose path is P, the creation of those symbols
    involved at most one call to NewPackage(P, ...). To ensure consistency,
    use a single Importer for all loaded packages and their dependencies.
    For more information, see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57497.

func IdenticalIgnoreTags(x, y Type) bool
    IdenticalIgnoreTags reports whether x and y are identical types if tags are
    ignored. Receivers of Signature types are ignored.

func Implements(V Type, T *Interface) bool
    Implements reports whether type V implements interface T.

    The behavior of Implements is unspecified if V is Typ[Invalid] or an
    uninstantiated generic type.

func IsInterface(t Type) bool
    IsInterface reports whether t is an interface type.

func ObjectString(obj Object, qf Qualifier) string
    ObjectString returns the string form of obj. The Qualifier controls the
    printing of package-level objects, and may be nil.

func Satisfies(V Type, T *Interface) bool
    Satisfies reports whether type V satisfies the constraint T.

    The behavior of Satisfies is unspecified if V is Typ[Invalid] or an
    uninstantiated generic type.

func SelectionString(s *Selection, qf Qualifier) string
    SelectionString returns the string form of s. The Qualifier controls the
    printing of package-level objects, and may be nil.

    Examples:

        "field (T) f int"
        "method (T) f(X) Y"
        "method expr (T) f(X) Y"

func TypeString(typ Type, qf Qualifier) string
    TypeString returns the string representation of typ. The Qualifier controls
    the printing of package-level objects, and may be nil.

func WriteExpr(buf *bytes.Buffer, x ast.Expr)
    WriteExpr writes the (possibly shortened) string representation for x to
    buf. Shortened representations are suitable for user interfaces but may not
    necessarily follow Go syntax.

func WriteSignature(buf *bytes.Buffer, sig *Signature, qf Qualifier)
    WriteSignature writes the representation of the signature sig to buf,
    without a leading "func" keyword. The Qualifier controls the printing of
    package-level objects, and may be nil.

func WriteType(buf *bytes.Buffer, typ Type, qf Qualifier)
    WriteType writes the string representation of typ to buf. The Qualifier
    controls the printing of package-level objects, and may be nil.


TYPES

type Alias struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    An Alias represents an alias type.

    Alias types are created by alias declarations such as:

        type A = int

    The type on the right-hand side of the declaration can be accessed using
    Alias.Rhs. This type may itself be an alias. Call Unalias to obtain the
    first non-alias type in a chain of alias type declarations.

    Like a defined (Named) type, an alias type has a name. Use the Alias.Obj
    method to access its TypeName object.

    Historically, Alias types were not materialized so that, in the example
    above, A's type was represented by a Basic (int), not an Alias whose
    Alias.Rhs is int. But Go 1.24 allows you to declare an alias type with type
    parameters or arguments:

        type Set[K comparable] = map[K]bool
        s := make(Set[String])

    and this requires that Alias types be materialized. Use the Alias.TypeParams
    and Alias.TypeArgs methods to access them.

    To ease the transition, the Alias type was introduced in go1.22,
    but the type-checker would not construct values of this type unless the
    GODEBUG=gotypesalias=1 environment variable was provided. Starting in
    go1.23, this variable is enabled by default. This setting also causes the
    predeclared type "any" to be represented as an Alias, not a bare Interface.

func NewAlias(obj *TypeName, rhs Type) *Alias
    NewAlias creates a new Alias type with the given type name and rhs. rhs must
    not be nil.

func (a *Alias) Obj() *TypeName
    Obj returns the type name for the declaration defining the alias type a.
    For instantiated types, this is same as the type name of the origin type.

func (a *Alias) Origin() *Alias
    Origin returns the generic Alias type of which a is an instance. If a is not
    an instance of a generic alias, Origin returns a.

func (a *Alias) Rhs() Type
    Rhs returns the type R on the right-hand side of an alias declaration "type
    A = R", which may be another alias.

func (a *Alias) SetTypeParams(tparams []*TypeParam)
    SetTypeParams sets the type parameters of the alias type a. The alias a must
    not have type arguments.

func (a *Alias) String() string

func (a *Alias) TypeArgs() *TypeList
    TypeArgs returns the type arguments used to instantiate the Alias type.
    If a is not an instance of a generic alias, the result is nil.

func (a *Alias) TypeParams() *TypeParamList
    TypeParams returns the type parameters of the alias type a, or nil.
    A generic Alias and its instances have the same type parameters.

func (a *Alias) Underlying() Type
    Underlying returns the underlying type of the alias type a, which is the
    underlying type of the aliased type. Underlying types are never Named,
    TypeParam, or Alias types.

)
type Builtin struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Builtin represents a built-in function. Builtins don't have a valid type.

func (obj *Builtin) Exported() bool
    Exported reports whether the object is exported (starts with a capital
    letter). It doesn't take into account whether the object is in a local
    (function) scope or not.

func (obj *Builtin) Id() string
    Id is a wrapper for Id(obj.Pkg(), obj.Name()).

func (obj *Builtin) Name() string

)
    The direction of a channel is indicated by one of these constants.

type Checker struct {
	*Info

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Checker maintains the state of the type checker. It must be created with
    NewChecker.

func NewChecker(conf *Config, fset *token.FileSet, pkg *Package, info *Info) *Checker
    NewChecker returns a new Checker instance for a given package. Package files
    may be added incrementally via checker.Files.

func (check *Checker) Files(files []*ast.File) (err error)
    Files checks the provided files as part of the checker's package.

type Config struct {
	// Context is the context used for resolving global identifiers. If nil, the
	// type checker will initialize this field with a newly created context.
	Context *Context

	// GoVersion describes the accepted Go language version. The string must
	// start with a prefix of the form "go%d.%d" (e.g. "go1.20", "go1.21rc1", or
	// "go1.21.0") or it must be empty; an empty string disables Go language
	// version checks. If the format is invalid, invoking the type checker will
	// result in an error.
	GoVersion string

	// If IgnoreFuncBodies is set, function bodies are not
	// type-checked.
	IgnoreFuncBodies bool

	// If FakeImportC is set, `import "C"` (for packages requiring Cgo)
	// declares an empty "C" package and errors are omitted for qualified
	// identifiers referring to package C (which won't find an object).
	// This feature is intended for the standard library cmd/api tool.
	//
	// Caution: Effects may be unpredictable due to follow-on errors.
	//          Do not use casually!
	FakeImportC bool

	// If Error != nil, it is called with each error found
	// during type checking; err has dynamic type Error.
	// Secondary errors (for instance, to enumerate all types
	// involved in an invalid recursive type declaration) have
	// error strings that start with a '\t' character.
	// If Error == nil, type-checking stops with the first
	// error found.
	Error func(err error)

	// An importer is used to import packages referred to from
	// import declarations.
	// If the installed importer implements ImporterFrom, the type
	// checker calls ImportFrom instead of Import.
	// The type checker reports an error if an importer is needed
	// but none was installed.
	Importer Importer

	// If Sizes != nil, it provides the sizing functions for package unsafe.
	// Otherwise SizesFor("gc", "amd64") is used instead.
	Sizes Sizes

	// If DisableUnusedImportCheck is set, packages are not checked
	// for unused imports.
	DisableUnusedImportCheck bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Config specifies the configuration for type checking. The zero value for
    Config is a ready-to-use default configuration.

func (conf *Config) Check(path string, fset *token.FileSet, files []*ast.File, info *Info) (*Package, error)
    Check type-checks a package and returns the resulting package object and the
    first error if any. Additionally, if info != nil, Check populates each of
    the non-nil maps in the Info struct.

    The package is marked as complete if no errors occurred, otherwise it is
    incomplete. See [Config.Error] for controlling behavior in the presence of
    errors.

    The package is specified by a list of *ast.Files and corresponding file set,
    and the package path the package is identified with. The clean path must not
    be empty or dot (".").

type Const struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Const represents a declared constant.

func NewConst(pos token.Pos, pkg *Package, name string, typ Type, val constant.Value) *Const
    NewConst returns a new constant with value val. The remaining arguments set
    the attributes found with all Objects.

func (obj *Const) Exported() bool
    Exported reports whether the object is exported (starts with a capital
    letter). It doesn't take into account whether the object is in a local
    (function) scope or not.

    Type returns the object's type.

func (obj *Const) Val() constant.Value
    Val returns the constant's value.

type Context struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Context is an opaque type checking context. It may be used to share
    identical type instances across type-checked packages or calls to
    Instantiate. Contexts are safe for concurrent use.

    The use of a shared context does not guarantee that identical instances are
    deduplicated in all cases.

func NewContext() *Context
    NewContext creates a new Context.

type Error struct {
	Fset *token.FileSet // file set for interpretation of Pos
	Pos  token.Pos      // error position
	Msg  string         // error message
	Soft bool           // if set, error is "soft"

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    An Error describes a type-checking error; it implements the error interface.
    A "soft" error is an error that still permits a valid interpretation of a
    package (such as "unused variable"); "hard" errors may lead to unpredictable
    behavior if ignored.

func (err Error) Error() string
    Error returns an error string formatted as follows: filename:line:column:
    message

type Func struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Func represents a declared function, concrete method, or abstract
    (interface) method. Its Type() is always a *Signature. An abstract method
    may belong to many interfaces due to embedding.

func MissingMethod(V Type, T *Interface, static bool) (method *Func, wrongType bool)
    MissingMethod returns (nil, false) if V implements T, otherwise it returns a
    missing method required by T and whether it is missing or just has the wrong
    type: either a pointer receiver or wrong signature.

    For non-interface types V, or if static is set, V implements T if all
    methods of T are present in V. Otherwise (V is an interface and static is
    not set), MissingMethod only checks that methods of T which are also present
    in V have matching types (e.g., for a type assertion x.(T) where x is of
    interface type V).

func NewFunc(pos token.Pos, pkg *Package, name string, sig *Signature) *Func
    NewFunc returns a new function with the given signature, representing the
    function's type.

func (obj *Func) Exported() bool
    Exported reports whether the object is exported (starts with a capital
    letter). It doesn't take into account whether the object is in a local
    (function) scope or not.

func (obj *Func) FullName() string
    FullName returns the package- or receiver-type-qualified name of function or
    method obj.

func (obj *Func) Id() string
    Id is a wrapper for Id(obj.Pkg(), obj.Name()).

func (obj *Func) Name() string
    Name returns the object's (package-local, unqualified) name.

func (obj *Func) Origin() *Func
    Origin returns the canonical Func for its receiver, i.e. the Func object
    recorded in Info.Defs.

    For synthetic functions created during instantiation (such as methods on an
    instantiated Named type or interface methods that depend on type arguments),
    this will be the corresponding Func on the generic (uninstantiated) type.
    For all other Funcs Origin returns the receiver.

func (obj *Func) Parent() *Scope
    Parent returns the scope in which the object is declared. The result is nil
    for methods and struct fields.

func (obj *Func) Pkg() *Package
    Pkg returns the package to which the function belongs.

    The result is nil for methods of types in the Universe scope, like method
    Error of the error built-in interface type.

func (obj *Func) Pos() token.Pos
    Pos returns the declaration position of the object's identifier.

func (obj *Func) Scope() *Scope
    Scope returns the scope of the function's body block. The result is nil
    for imported or instantiated functions and methods (but there is also no
    mechanism to get to an instantiated function).

func (obj *Func) Signature() *Signature
    Signature returns the signature (type) of the function or method.

func (obj *Func) String() string

func (obj *Func) Type() Type
    Type returns the object's type.

type ImportMode int
    ImportMode is reserved for future use.

type Importer interface {
	// Import returns the imported package for the given import path.
	// The semantics is like for ImporterFrom.ImportFrom except that
	// dir and mode are ignored (since they are not present).
	Import(path string) (*Package, error)
}
    An Importer resolves import paths to Packages.

    CAUTION: This interface does not support the import of locally vendored
    packages. See https://golang.org/s/go15vendor. If possible, external
    implementations should implement ImporterFrom.

type ImporterFrom interface {
	// Importer is present for backward-compatibility. Calling
	// Import(path) is the same as calling ImportFrom(path, "", 0);
	// i.e., locally vendored packages may not be found.
	// The types package does not call Import if an ImporterFrom
	// is present.
	Importer

	// ImportFrom returns the imported package for the given import
	// path when imported by a package file located in dir.
	// If the import failed, besides returning an error, ImportFrom
	// is encouraged to cache and return a package anyway, if one
	// was created. This will reduce package inconsistencies and
	// follow-on type checker errors due to the missing package.
	// The mode value must be 0; it is reserved for future use.
	// Two calls to ImportFrom with the same path and dir must
	// return the same package.
	ImportFrom(path, dir string, mode ImportMode) (*Package, error)
}
    An ImporterFrom resolves import paths to packages; it supports vendoring per
    https://golang.org/s/go15vendor. Use go/importer to obtain an ImporterFrom
    implementation.

type Info struct {
	// Types maps expressions to their types, and for constant
	// expressions, also their values. Invalid expressions are
	// omitted.
	//
	// For (possibly parenthesized) identifiers denoting built-in
	// functions, the recorded signatures are call-site specific:
	// if the call result is not a constant, the recorded type is
	// an argument-specific signature. Otherwise, the recorded type
	// is invalid.
	//
	// The Types map does not record the type of every identifier,
	// only those that appear where an arbitrary expression is
	// permitted. For instance:
	// - an identifier f in a selector expression x.f is found
	//   only in the Selections map;
	// - an identifier z in a variable declaration 'var z int'
	//   is found only in the Defs map;
	// - an identifier p denoting a package in a qualified
	//   identifier p.X is found only in the Uses map.
	//
	// Similarly, no type is recorded for the (synthetic) FuncType

func (info *Info) PkgNameOf(imp *ast.ImportSpec) *PkgName
    PkgNameOf returns the local package name defined by the import, or nil if
    not found.

    For dot-imports, the package name is ".".

    Precondition: the Defs and Implicts maps are populated.

type Instance struct {
	TypeArgs *TypeList
	Type     Type
}
    Instance reports the type arguments and instantiated type for type and
    function instantiations. For type instantiations, Type will be of dynamic

}
    An Interface represents an interface type.

func NewInterface(methods []*Func, embeddeds []*Named) *Interface

func NewInterfaceType(methods []*Func, embeddeds []Type) *Interface
    NewInterfaceType returns a new interface for the given methods and embedded
    types. NewInterfaceType takes ownership of the provided methods and may
    modify their types by setting missing receivers.

    To avoid race conditions, the interface's type set should be computed before
    concurrent use of the interface, by explicitly calling Complete.

func (t *Interface) Complete() *Interface
    Complete computes the interface's type set. It must be called by users of
    NewInterfaceType and NewInterface after the interface's embedded types are
    fully defined and before using the interface type in any way other than
    to form other types. The interface must not contain duplicate methods or a
    panic occurs. Complete returns the receiver.

    Interface types that have been completed are safe for concurrent use.

func (t *Interface) Embedded(i int) *Named
    Embedded returns the i'th embedded defined (*Named) type of interface t for
    0 <= i < t.NumEmbeddeds(). The result is nil if the i'th embedded type is

func (t *Interface) IsMethodSet() bool
    IsMethodSet reports whether the interface t is fully described by its method
    set.

func (t *Interface) MarkImplicit()
    MarkImplicit marks the interface t as implicit, meaning this interface
    corresponds to a constraint literal such as ~T or A|B without explicit
    interface embedding. MarkImplicit should be called before any concurrent use
    of implicit interfaces.

}
    A MethodSet is an ordered set of concrete or abstract (interface) methods;
    a method is a MethodVal selection, and they are ordered by ascending
    m.Obj().Id(). The zero value for a MethodSet is a ready-to-use empty method
    set.

func NewMethodSet(T Type) *MethodSet
    NewMethodSet returns the method set for the given type T. It always returns
    a non-nil method set, even if it is empty.

type Named struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Named represents a named (defined) type.

    A declaration such as:

        type S struct { ... }

    creates a defined type whose underlying type is a struct, and binds this
    type to the object S, a TypeName. Use Named.Underlying to access the
    underlying type. Use Named.Obj to obtain the object S.

    Before type aliases (Go 1.9), the spec called defined types "named types".

func NewNamed(obj *TypeName, underlying Type, methods []*Func) *Named
    NewNamed returns a new named type for the given type name, underlying type,
    and associated methods. If the given type name obj doesn't have a type yet,
    its type is set to the returned named type. The underlying type must not be
    a *Named.

func (t *Named) AddMethod(m *Func)
    AddMethod adds method m unless it is already in the method list. The method
    must be in the same package as t, and t must not have type arguments.

func (t *Named) Method(i int) *Func
    Method returns the i'th method of named type t for 0 <= i < t.NumMethods().

    For an ordinary or instantiated type t, the receiver base type of this
    method is the named type t. For an uninstantiated generic type t, each
    method receiver is instantiated with its receiver type parameters.

    Methods are numbered deterministically: given the same list of source
    files presented to the type checker, or the same sequence of NewMethod
    and AddMethod calls, the mapping from method index to corresponding method
    remains the same. But the specific ordering is not specified and must not be
    relied on as it may change in the future.

    Origin returns the generic type from which the named type t is instantiated.
    If t is not an instantiated type, the result is t.

func (t *Named) SetTypeParams(tparams []*TypeParam)

    forwarding declarations. Underlying types are never Named, TypeParam,
    or Alias types.

[underlying type]: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Underlying_types.

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Nil represents the predeclared value nil.

func (obj *Nil) Exported() bool
    Exported reports whether the object is exported (starts with a capital
    letter). It doesn't take into account whether the object is in a local
    (function) scope or not.

func (obj *Nil) Id() string
    Id is a wrapper for Id(obj.Pkg(), obj.Name()).

func (obj *Nil) Name() string
    Name returns the object's (package-local, unqualified) name.

func (obj *Nil) Parent() *Scope
    Parent returns the scope in which the object is declared. The result is nil
    for methods and struct fields.

func (obj *Nil) Pkg() *Package

func (obj *Nil) String() string

func (obj *Nil) Type() Type
    Type returns the object's type.

type Object interface {
	Parent() *Scope // scope in which this object is declared; nil for methods and struct fields
	Pos() token.Pos // position of object identifier in declaration
	Pkg() *Package  // package to which this object belongs; nil for labels and objects in the Universe scope
	Name() string   // package local object name
	Type() Type     // object type
	Exported() bool // reports whether the name starts with a capital letter
	Id() string     // object name if exported, qualified name if not exported (see func Id)

	// String returns a human-readable string of the object.
	// Use [ObjectString] to control how package names are formatted in the string.
	String() string

	// Has unexported methods.
}
    An Object is a named language entity. An Object may be a constant (Const),
    type name (TypeName), variable or struct field (Var), function or method
    (Func), imported package (PkgName), label (Label), built-in function
    (Builtin), or the predeclared identifier 'nil' (Nil).

    The environment, which is structured as a tree of Scopes, maps each name to
    the unique Object that it denotes.

func LookupFieldOrMethod(T Type, addressable bool, pkg *Package, name string) (obj Object, index []int, indirect bool)
    LookupFieldOrMethod looks up a field or method with given package and
    name in T and returns the corresponding *Var or *Func, an index sequence,
    and a bool indicating if there were any pointer indirections on the path to
    the field or method. If addressable is set, T is the type of an addressable
    variable (only matters for method lookups). T must not be nil.

    The last index entry is the field or method index in the (possibly embedded)
    type where the entry was found, either:

     1. the list of declared methods of a named type; or
     2. the list of all methods (method set) of an interface type; or
     3. the list of fields of a struct type.

    The earlier index entries are the indices of the embedded struct fields
    traversed to get to the found entry, starting at depth 0.

    If no entry is found, a nil object is returned. In this case, the returned
    index and indirect values have the following meaning:

      - If index != nil, the index sequence points to an ambiguous entry (the
        same name appeared more than once at the same embedding level).

      - If indirect is set, a method with a pointer receiver type was found but
        there was no pointer on the path from the actual receiver type to the
        method's formal receiver base type, nor was the receiver addressable.

    See also LookupSelection, which returns the result as a Selection.

    go/ast.File.GoVersion field.

func (pkg *Package) Imports() []*Package
    Imports returns the list of packages directly imported by pkg; the list is
    in source order.

    If pkg was loaded from export data, Imports includes packages that provide
    package-level objects referenced by pkg. This may be more or less than the
    set of packages directly imported by pkg's source code.

    If pkg uses cgo and the FakeImportC configuration option was enabled,
    the imports list may contain a fake "C" package.

func (pkg *Package) MarkComplete()

func (p *Pointer) String() string

func (p *Pointer) Underlying() Type

type Qualifier func(*Package) string
    A Qualifier controls how named package-level objects are printed in calls to
    TypeString, ObjectString, and SelectionString.

    These three formatting routines call the Qualifier for each package-level
    object O, and if the Qualifier returns a non-empty string p, the object is
    printed in the form p.O. If it returns an empty string, only the object name
    O is printed.

    Using a nil Qualifier is equivalent to using (*Package).Path: the object is
    qualified by the import path, e.g., "encoding/json.Marshal".

func RelativeTo(pkg *Package) Qualifier
    RelativeTo returns a Qualifier that fully qualifies members of all packages
    other than pkg.

type Scope struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Scope maintains a set of objects and links to its containing (parent) and
    contained (children) scopes. Objects may be inserted and looked up by name.
    The zero value for Scope is a ready-to-use empty scope.

var Universe *Scope
    The Universe scope contains all predeclared objects of Go. It is the
    outermost scope of any chain of nested scopes.

func NewScope(parent *Scope, pos, end token.Pos, comment string) *Scope
    NewScope returns a new, empty scope contained in the given parent scope,
    if any. The comment is for debugging only.

func (s *Scope) Children() iter.Seq[*Scope]
    Children returns a go1.23 iterator over the child scopes nested within scope
    s.

    Example: for child := range scope.Children() { ... }

func (s *Scope) Contains(pos token.Pos) bool
    Contains reports whether pos is within the scope's extent. The result is
    guaranteed to be valid only if the type-checked AST has complete position
    information.

func (s *Scope) End() token.Pos

func (s *Scope) Innermost(pos token.Pos) *Scope
    Innermost returns the innermost (child) scope containing pos. If pos is not
    within any scope, the result is nil. The result is also nil for the Universe
    scope. The result is guaranteed to be valid only if the type-checked AST has
    complete position information.

func (s *Scope) Insert(obj Object) Object
    Insert attempts to insert an object obj into scope s. If s already contains
    an alternative object alt with the same name, Insert leaves s unchanged and
    returns alt. Otherwise it inserts obj, sets the object's parent scope if not
    already set, and returns nil.

func (s *Scope) Len() int
    Len returns the number of scope elements.

func (s *Scope) Lookup(name string) Object
    Lookup returns the object in scope s with the given name if such an object
    exists; otherwise the result is nil.

func (s *Scope) LookupParent(name string, pos token.Pos) (*Scope, Object)
    LookupParent follows the parent chain of scopes starting with s until it
    finds a scope where Lookup(name) returns a non-nil object, and then returns
    that scope and object. If a valid position pos is provided, only objects
    that were declared at or before pos are considered. If no such scope and
    object exists, the result is (nil, nil). The results are guaranteed to be
    valid only if the type-checked AST has complete position information.

    Note that obj.Parent() may be different from the returned scope if the
    object was inserted into the scope and already had a parent at that time
    (see Insert). This can only happen for dot-imported objects whose parent is
    the scope of the package that exported them.

func (s *Scope) Names() []string
    Names returns the scope's element names in sorted order.

func (s *Scope) NumChildren() int
    NumChildren returns the number of scopes nested in s.

func (s *Scope) Parent() *Scope
    Parent returns the scope's containing (parent) scope.

func (s *Scope) Pos() token.Pos
    Pos and End describe the scope's source code extent [pos, end). The results
    are guaranteed to be valid only if the type-checked AST has complete
    position information. The extent is undefined for Universe and package
    scopes.

func (s *Scope) String() string
    String returns a string representation of the scope, for debugging.

func (s *Scope) WriteTo(w io.Writer, n int, recurse bool)
    WriteTo writes a string representation of the scope to w, with the scope
    elements sorted by name. The level of indentation is controlled by n >= 0,
    with n == 0 for no indentation. If recurse is set, it also writes nested
    (children) scopes.

type Selection struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Selection describes a selector expression x.f. For the declarations:

        type T struct{ x int; E }
        type E struct{}
        func (e E) m() {}
        var p *T

    the following relations exist:

        Selector    Kind          Recv    Obj    Type       Index     Indirect

        p.x         FieldVal      T       x      int        {0}       true
        p.m         MethodVal     *T      m      func()     {1, 0}    true
        T.m         MethodExpr    T       m      func(T)    {1, 0}    false

func LookupSelection(T Type, addressable bool, pkg *Package, name string) (Selection, bool)
    LookupSelection selects the field or method whose ID is Id(pkg, name),
    on a value of type T. If addressable is set, T is the type of an addressable
    variable (this matters only for method lookups). T must not be nil.

    If the selection is valid:

      - Selection.Obj returns the field (Var) or method (Func);
      - Selection.Indirect reports whether there were any pointer indirections
        on the path to the field or method.
      - Selection.Index returns the index sequence, defined below.

    The last index entry is the field or method index in the (possibly embedded)
    type where the entry was found, either:

     1. the list of declared methods of a named type; or
     2. the list of all methods (method set) of an interface type; or
     3. the list of fields of a struct type.

    The earlier index entries are the indices of the embedded struct fields
    traversed to get to the found entry, starting at depth 0.

    See also LookupFieldOrMethod, which returns the components separately.

func (s *Selection) Index() []int
    Index describes the path from x to f in x.f. The last index entry is the
    field or method index of the type declaring f; either:

     1. the list of declared methods of a named type; or
     2. the list of methods of an interface type; or
     3. the list of fields of a struct type.

    The earlier index entries are the indices of the embedded fields implicitly
    traversed to get from (the type of) x to f, starting at embedding depth 0.

func (s *Selection) Indirect() bool
    Indirect reports whether any pointer indirection was required to get from x
    to f in x.f.

    Beware: Indirect spuriously returns true (Go issue #8353) for a MethodVal
    selection in which the receiver argument and parameter both have type *T so
    there is no indirection. Unfortunately, a fix is too risky.

func (s *Selection) Kind() SelectionKind
    Kind returns the selection kind.

func (s *Selection) Obj() Object
    Obj returns the object denoted by x.f; a *Var for a field selection,
    and a *Func in all other cases.

func (s *Selection) Recv() Type
    Recv returns the type of x in x.f.

func (s *Selection) String() string

func (s *Selection) Type() Type
    Type returns the type of x.f, which may be different from the type of f.
    See Selection for more information.

type SelectionKind int
    SelectionKind describes the kind of a selector expression x.f (excluding
    qualified identifiers).

    If x is a struct or *struct, a selector expression x.f may denote a sequence
    of selection operations x.a.b.c.f. The SelectionKind describes the kind of
    the final (explicit) operation; all the previous (implicit) operations are
    always field selections. Each element of Indices specifies an implicit field
    (a, b, c) by its index in the struct type of the field selection operand.

    For a FieldVal operation, the final selection refers to the field specified
    by Selection.Obj.

    For a MethodVal operation, the final selection refers to a method. If the
    "pointerness" of the method's declared receiver does not match that of the
    effective receiver after implicit field selection, then an & or * operation
    is implicitly applied to the receiver variable or value. So, x.f denotes
    (&x.a.b.c).f when f requires a pointer receiver but x.a.b.c is a non-pointer
    variable; and it denotes (*x.a.b.c).f when f requires a non-pointer receiver
    but x.a.b.c is a pointer value.

    All pointer indirections, whether due to implicit or explicit field
    selections or * operations inserted for "pointerness", panic if applied to a
    nil pointer, so a method call x.f() may panic even before the function call.

    By contrast, a MethodExpr operation T.f is essentially equivalent to a
    function literal of the form:

        func(x T, args) (results) { return x.f(args) }

    Consequently, any implicit field selections and * operations inserted for
    "pointerness" are not evaluated until the function is called, so a T.f or
    (*T).f expression never panics.

const (
	FieldVal   SelectionKind = iota // x.f is a struct field selector
	MethodVal                       // x.f is a method selector
	MethodExpr                      // x.f is a method expression
)
type Signature struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Signature represents a (non-builtin) function or method type. The receiver
    is ignored when comparing signatures for identity.

func NewSignature(recv *Var, params, results *Tuple, variadic bool) *Signature
    NewSignature returns a new function type for the given receiver, parameters,
    and results, either of which may be nil. If variadic is set, the function is
    variadic, it must have at least one parameter, and the last parameter must
    be of unnamed slice type.

    Deprecated: Use NewSignatureType instead which allows for type parameters.

func NewSignatureType(recv *Var, recvTypeParams, typeParams []*TypeParam, params, results *Tuple, variadic bool) *Signature
    NewSignatureType creates a new function type for the given receiver,
    receiver type parameters, type parameters, parameters, and results.
    If variadic is set, params must hold at least one parameter and the last
    parameter must be an unnamed slice or a type parameter whose type set has
    an unnamed slice as common underlying type. As a special case, for variadic
    signatures the last parameter may also be a string type, or a type parameter
    containing a mix of byte slices and string types in its type set. If recv
    is non-nil, typeParams must be empty. If recvTypeParams is non-empty,
    recv must be non-nil.

func (s *Signature) Params() *Tuple
    Params returns the parameters of signature s, or nil.

func (s *Signature) Recv() *Var
    Recv returns the receiver of signature s (if a method), or nil if a
    function. It is ignored when comparing signatures for identity.

    For an abstract method, Recv returns the enclosing interface either as a
    *Named or an *Interface. Due to embedding, an interface may contain methods
    whose receiver type is a different interface.

func (s *Signature) RecvTypeParams() *TypeParamList
    RecvTypeParams returns the receiver type parameters of signature s, or nil.

func (s *Signature) Results() *Tuple
    Results returns the results of signature s, or nil.

func (s *Signature) String() string

func (s *Signature) TypeParams() *TypeParamList
    TypeParams returns the type parameters of signature s, or nil.

func (s *Signature) Underlying() Type

func (s *Signature) Variadic() bool
    Variadic reports whether the signature s is variadic.

type Sizes interface {
	// Alignof returns the alignment of a variable of type T.
	// Alignof must implement the alignment guarantees required by the spec.
	// The result must be >= 1.
	Alignof(T Type) int64

	// Offsetsof returns the offsets of the given struct fields, in bytes.
	// Offsetsof must implement the offset guarantees required by the spec.
	// A negative entry in the result indicates that the struct is too large.
	Offsetsof(fields []*Var) []int64

	// Sizeof returns the size of a variable of type T.
	// Sizeof must implement the size guarantees required by the spec.
	// A negative result indicates that T is too large.
	Sizeof(T Type) int64
}
    Sizes defines the sizing functions for package unsafe.

func SizesFor(compiler, arch string) Sizes
    SizesFor returns the Sizes used by a compiler for an architecture.
    The result is nil if a compiler/architecture pair is not known.

    Supported architectures for compiler "gc": "386", "amd64", "amd64p32",
    "arm", "arm64", "loong64", "mips", "mipsle", "mips64", "mips64le", "ppc64",
    "ppc64le", "riscv64", "s390x", "sparc64", "wasm".

type Slice struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}

    NewSlice returns a new slice type for the given element type.

func (s *Slice) Elem() Type
    Elem returns the element type of slice s.

func (s *Slice) String() string

func (s *Slice) Underlying() Type

type StdSizes struct {
	WordSize int64 // word size in bytes - must be >= 4 (32bits)
	MaxAlign int64 // maximum alignment in bytes - must be >= 1
}
    StdSizes is a convenience type for creating commonly used Sizes. It makes
    the following simplifying assumptions:

      - The size of explicitly sized basic types (int16, etc.) is the specified
        size.
      - The size of strings and interfaces is 2*WordSize.
      - The size of slices is 3*WordSize.
      - The size of an array of n elements corresponds to the size of a struct
        of n consecutive fields of the array's element type.
      - The size of a struct is the offset of the last field plus that field's
        size. As with all element types, if the struct is used in an array its
        size must first be aligned to a multiple of the struct's alignment.
      - All other types have size WordSize.
      - Arrays and structs are aligned per spec definition; all other types are
        naturally aligned with a maximum alignment MaxAlign.

    *StdSizes implements Sizes.

func (s *StdSizes) Alignof(T Type) (result int64)

func (s *StdSizes) Offsetsof(fields []*Var) []int64

func (s *StdSizes) Sizeof(T Type) int64

type Struct struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Struct represents a struct type.

func NewStruct(fields []*Var, tags []string) *Struct
    NewStruct returns a new struct with the given fields and corresponding
    field tags. If a field with index i has a tag, tags[i] must be that tag,
    but len(tags) may be only as long as required to hold the tag with the
    largest index i. Consequently, if no field has a tag, tags may be nil.

func (s *Struct) Field(i int) *Var
    Field returns the i'th field for 0 <= i < NumFields().

func (s *Struct) Fields() iter.Seq[*Var]
    Fields returns a go1.23 iterator over the fields of a struct type.

    Example: for field := range s.Fields() { ... }

func (s *Struct) NumFields() int

    embedded fields).

func (t *Struct) String() string

func (s *Struct) Tag(i int) string
    Tag returns the i'th field tag for 0 <= i < NumFields().

func (t *Struct) Underlying() Type

type Term term
    A Term represents a term in a Union.

func NewTerm(tilde bool, typ Type) *Term
    NewTerm returns a new union term.

func (t *Term) String() string

func (t *Term) Tilde() bool

func (t *Term) Type() Type

type Tuple struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Tuple represents an ordered list of variables; a nil *Tuple is a valid
    (empty) tuple. Tuples are used as components of signatures and to represent
    the type of multiple assignments; they are not first class types of Go.

func NewTuple(x ...*Var) *Tuple
    NewTuple returns a new tuple for the given variables.

func (t *Tuple) At(i int) *Var
    At returns the i'th variable of tuple t.

func (t *Tuple) Len() int
    Len returns the number variables of tuple t.

func (t *Tuple) String() string

func (t *Tuple) Underlying() Type

func (t *Tuple) Variables() iter.Seq[*Var]
    Variables returns a go1.23 iterator over the variables of a tuple type.

    Example: for v := range tuple.Variables() { ... }

type Type interface {
	// Underlying returns the underlying type of a type.
	// Underlying types are never Named, TypeParam, or Alias types.
	//
	// See https://go.dev/ref/spec#Underlying_types.
	Underlying() Type

	// String returns a string representation of a type.
	String() string
}
    A Type represents a type of Go. All types implement the Type interface.

func Default(t Type) Type
    Default returns the default "typed" type for an "untyped" type; it returns
    the incoming type for all other types. The default type for untyped nil is
    untyped nil.

func Instantiate(ctxt *Context, orig Type, targs []Type, validate bool) (Type, error)
    Instantiate instantiates the type orig with the given type arguments targs.
    orig must be an *Alias, *Named, or *Signature type. If there is no error,
    the resulting Type is an instantiated type of the same kind (*Alias,
    *Named or *Signature, respectively).

    Methods attached to a *Named type are also instantiated, and associated
    with a new *Func that has the same position as the original method, but nil
    function scope.

    If ctxt is non-nil, it may be used to de-duplicate the instance against
    previous instances with the same identity. As a special case, generic
    *Signature origin types are only considered identical if they are pointer
    equivalent, so that instantiating distinct (but possibly identical)
    signatures will yield different instances. The use of a shared context does
    not guarantee that identical instances are deduplicated in all cases.

    If validate is set, Instantiate verifies that the number of type arguments
    and parameters match, and that the type arguments satisfy their respective
    type constraints. If verification fails, the resulting error may wrap an
    *ArgumentError indicating which type argument did not satisfy its type
    parameter constraint, and why.

    If validate is not set, Instantiate does not verify the type argument
    count or whether the type arguments satisfy their constraints. Instantiate
    is guaranteed to not return an error, but may panic. Specifically, for
    *Signature types, Instantiate will panic immediately if the type argument
    count is incorrect; for *Named types, a panic may occur later inside the
    *Named API.

func Unalias(t Type) Type
    Unalias returns t if it is not an alias type; otherwise it follows t's
    alias chain until it reaches a non-alias type which is then returned.
    Consequently, the result is never an alias type.

type TypeAndValue struct {
	Type  Type
	Value constant.Value
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    TypeAndValue reports the type and value (for constants) of the corresponding
    expression.

func Eval(fset *token.FileSet, pkg *Package, pos token.Pos, expr string) (_ TypeAndValue, err error)
    Eval returns the type and, if constant, the value for the expression expr,
    evaluated at position pos of package pkg, which must have been derived from
    type-checking an AST with complete position information relative to the
    provided file set.

    The meaning of the parameters fset, pkg, and pos is the same as in
    CheckExpr. An error is returned if expr cannot be parsed successfully,
    or the resulting expr AST cannot be type-checked.

    value nil.

func (tv TypeAndValue) IsType() bool
    IsType reports whether the corresponding expression specifies a type.

func (tv TypeAndValue) IsValue() bool
    IsValue reports whether the corresponding expression is a value. Builtins
    are not considered values. Constant values have a non- nil Value.

    IsVoid reports whether the corresponding expression is a function call
    without results.

type TypeList struct {
	// Has unexported fields.

    type (Named), an alias type (Alias), a type parameter (TypeParam), or a
    predeclared type such as int or error.

func NewTypeName(pos token.Pos, pkg *Package, name string, typ Type) *TypeName
    NewTypeName returns a new type name denoting the given typ. The remaining
    arguments set the attributes found with all Objects.

    The typ argument may be a defined (Named) type or an alias type. It may also
    be nil such that the returned TypeName can be used as argument for NewNamed,
    which will set the TypeName's type as a side- effect.

func (obj *TypeName) Exported() bool
    Exported reports whether the object is exported (starts with a capital
    letter). It doesn't take into account whether the object is in a local
    (function) scope or not.

    declaration.

    A TypeParam has a name; use the TypeParam.Obj method to access its TypeName
    object.

func NewTypeParam(obj *TypeName, constraint Type) *TypeParam
    NewTypeParam returns a new TypeParam. Type parameters may be set on a Named
    type by calling SetTypeParams. Setting a type parameter on more than one
    type will result in a panic.

    The constraint argument can be nil, and set later via SetConstraint.
    If the constraint is non-nil, it must be fully defined.

func (t *TypeParam) Constraint() Type
    Constraint returns the type constraint specified for t.

func (t *TypeParam) Index() int

    the type parameter has not yet been bound to a type.

func (t *TypeParam) Obj() *TypeName
    Obj returns the type name for the type parameter t.

func (t *TypeParam) SetConstraint(bound Type)
    SetConstraint sets the type constraint for t.

    It must be called by users of NewTypeParam after the bound's underlying is
    fully defined, and before using the type parameter in any way other than
    to form other types. Once SetConstraint returns the receiver, t is safe for
    concurrent use.

func (t *TypeParam) String() string

func (t *TypeParam) Underlying() Type
    Underlying returns the underlying type of the type parameter t, which is the
    underlying type of its constraint. This type is always an interface.

[underlying type]: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Underlying_types.

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Union represents a union of terms embedded in an interface.

    results, and struct fields).

func NewField(pos token.Pos, pkg *Package, name string, typ Type, embedded bool) *Var
    NewField returns a new variable representing a struct field. For embedded
    fields, the name is the unqualified type name under which the field is
    accessible.

func NewParam(pos token.Pos, pkg *Package, name string, typ Type) *Var
    NewParam returns a new variable representing a function parameter.

    The caller must subsequently call Var.SetKind if the desired Var is not of
    kind ParamVar: for example, RecvVar or ResultVar.

func NewVar(pos token.Pos, pkg *Package, name string, typ Type) *Var
    NewVar returns a new variable. The arguments set the attributes found with
    all Objects.

    The caller must subsequently call Var.SetKind if the desired Var is not of

    recorded in Info.Defs.

    For synthetic Vars created during instantiation (such as struct fields
    or function parameters that depend on type arguments), this will be the
    corresponding Var on the generic (uninstantiated) type. For all other Vars
    Origin returns the receiver.
