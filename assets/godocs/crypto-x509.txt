package x509 // import "crypto/x509"

Package x509 implements a subset of the X.509 standard.

It allows parsing and generating certificates, certificate signing requests,
certificate revocation lists, and encoded public and private keys. It provides a
certificate verifier, complete with a chain builder.

The package targets the X.509 technical profile defined by the IETF (RFC
2459/3280/5280), and as further restricted by the CA/Browser Forum Baseline
Requirements. There is minimal support for features outside of these profiles,
as the primary goal of the package is to provide compatibility with the publicly
trusted TLS certificate ecosystem and its policies and constraints.

On macOS and Windows, certificate verification is handled by system APIs, but
the package aims to apply consistent validation rules across operating systems.

VARIABLES

var ErrUnsupportedAlgorithm = errors.New("x509: cannot verify signature: algorithm unimplemented")
    ErrUnsupportedAlgorithm results from attempting to perform an operation that
    involves algorithms that are not currently implemented.

var IncorrectPasswordError = errors.New("x509: decryption password incorrect")
    IncorrectPasswordError is returned when an incorrect password is detected.


FUNCTIONS

func CreateCertificate(rand io.Reader, template, parent *Certificate, pub, priv any) ([]byte, error)
    CreateCertificate creates a new X.509 v3 certificate based on a template.
    The following members of template are currently used:

      - AuthorityKeyId
      - BasicConstraintsValid
      - CRLDistributionPoints
      - DNSNames
      - EmailAddresses
      - ExcludedDNSDomains
      - ExcludedEmailAddresses
      - ExcludedIPRanges
      - ExcludedURIDomains
      - ExtKeyUsage
      - ExtraExtensions
      - IPAddresses
      - IsCA
      - IssuingCertificateURL
      - KeyUsage
      - MaxPathLen
      - MaxPathLenZero
      - NotAfter
      - NotBefore
      - OCSPServer
      - PermittedDNSDomains
      - PermittedDNSDomainsCritical
      - PermittedEmailAddresses
      - PermittedIPRanges
      - PermittedURIDomains
      - PolicyIdentifiers (see note below)
      - Policies (see note below)
      - SerialNumber
      - SignatureAlgorithm
      - Subject
      - SubjectKeyId
      - URIs
      - UnknownExtKeyUsage

    The certificate is signed by parent. If parent is equal to template then
    the certificate is self-signed. The parameter pub is the public key of the
    certificate to be generated and priv is the private key of the signer.

    The returned slice is the certificate in DER encoding.

    The currently supported key types are *rsa.PublicKey, *ecdsa.PublicKey and
    ed25519.PublicKey. pub must be a supported key type, and priv must be a
    crypto.Signer or crypto.MessageSigner with a supported public key.

    The AuthorityKeyId will be taken from the SubjectKeyId of parent, if any,
    unless the resulting certificate is self-signed. Otherwise the value from
    template will be used.

    If SubjectKeyId from template is empty and the template is a CA,
    SubjectKeyId will be generated from the hash of the public key.

    If template.SerialNumber is nil, a serial number will be generated which
    conforms to RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.2 using entropy from rand.

    The PolicyIdentifier and Policies fields can both be used to marshal
    certificate policy OIDs. By default, only the Policies is marshaled,
    but if the GODEBUG setting "x509usepolicies" has the value "0", the
    PolicyIdentifiers field will be marshaled instead of the Policies field.
    This changed in Go 1.24. The Policies field can be used to marshal policy
    OIDs which have components that are larger than 31 bits.

func CreateCertificateRequest(rand io.Reader, template *CertificateRequest, priv any) (csr []byte, err error)
    CreateCertificateRequest creates a new certificate request based on a
    template. The following members of template are used:

      - SignatureAlgorithm
      - Subject
      - DNSNames
      - EmailAddresses
      - IPAddresses
      - URIs
      - ExtraExtensions
      - Attributes (deprecated)

    priv is the private key to sign the CSR with, and the corresponding
    public key will be included in the CSR. It must implement crypto.Signer or
    crypto.MessageSigner and its Public() method must return a *rsa.PublicKey
    or a *ecdsa.PublicKey or a ed25519.PublicKey. (A *rsa.PrivateKey,
    *ecdsa.PrivateKey or ed25519.PrivateKey satisfies this.)

    The returned slice is the certificate request in DER encoding.

func CreateRevocationList(rand io.Reader, template *RevocationList, issuer *Certificate, priv crypto.Signer) ([]byte, error)
    CreateRevocationList creates a new X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation List,
    according to RFC 5280, based on template.

    The CRL is signed by priv which should be a crypto.Signer or
    crypto.MessageSigner associated with the public key in the issuer
    certificate.

    The issuer may not be nil, and the crlSign bit must be set in KeyUsage in
    order to use it as a CRL issuer.

    The issuer distinguished name CRL field and authority key identifier
    extension are populated using the issuer certificate. issuer must have
    SubjectKeyId set.

func DecryptPEMBlock(b *pem.Block, password []byte) ([]byte, error)
    DecryptPEMBlock takes a PEM block encrypted according to RFC 1423 and the
    password used to encrypt it and returns a slice of decrypted DER encoded
    bytes. It inspects the DEK-Info header to determine the algorithm used
    for decryption. If no DEK-Info header is present, an error is returned.
    If an incorrect password is detected an IncorrectPasswordError is returned.
    Because of deficiencies in the format, it's not always possible to detect
    an incorrect password. In these cases no error will be returned but the
    decrypted DER bytes will be random noise.

    Deprecated: Legacy PEM encryption as specified in RFC 1423 is insecure by
    design. Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to
    padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

func EncryptPEMBlock(rand io.Reader, blockType string, data, password []byte, alg PEMCipher) (*pem.Block, error)
    EncryptPEMBlock returns a PEM block of the specified type holding the
    given DER encoded data encrypted with the specified algorithm and password
    according to RFC 1423.

    Deprecated: Legacy PEM encryption as specified in RFC 1423 is insecure by
    design. Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to
    padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

func IsEncryptedPEMBlock(b *pem.Block) bool
    IsEncryptedPEMBlock returns whether the PEM block is password encrypted
    according to RFC 1423.

    Deprecated: Legacy PEM encryption as specified in RFC 1423 is insecure by
    design. Since it does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to
    padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

func MarshalECPrivateKey(key *ecdsa.PrivateKey) ([]byte, error)
    MarshalECPrivateKey converts an EC private key to SEC 1, ASN.1 DER form.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "EC PRIVATE
    KEY". For a more flexible key format which is not EC specific, use
    MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey.

func MarshalPKCS1PrivateKey(key *rsa.PrivateKey) []byte
    MarshalPKCS1PrivateKey converts an RSA private key to PKCS #1, ASN.1 DER
    form.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "RSA PRIVATE
    KEY". For a more flexible key format which is not RSA specific, use
    MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey.

    The key must have passed validation by calling rsa.PrivateKey.Validate
    first. MarshalPKCS1PrivateKey calls rsa.PrivateKey.Precompute, which may
    modify the key if not already precomputed.

func MarshalPKCS1PublicKey(key *rsa.PublicKey) []byte
    MarshalPKCS1PublicKey converts an RSA public key to PKCS #1, ASN.1 DER form.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "RSA PUBLIC KEY".

func MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey(key any) ([]byte, error)
    MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey converts a private key to PKCS #8, ASN.1 DER form.

    The following key types are currently supported: *rsa.PrivateKey,
    *ecdsa.PrivateKey, ed25519.PrivateKey (not a pointer), and *ecdh.PrivateKey.
    Unsupported key types result in an error.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "PRIVATE KEY".

    MarshalPKCS8PrivateKey runs rsa.PrivateKey.Precompute on RSA keys.

func MarshalPKIXPublicKey(pub any) ([]byte, error)
    MarshalPKIXPublicKey converts a public key to PKIX, ASN.1 DER form.
    The encoded public key is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure (see RFC 5280,
    Section 4.1).

    The following key types are currently supported: *rsa.PublicKey,
    *ecdsa.PublicKey, ed25519.PublicKey (not a pointer), and *ecdh.PublicKey.
    Unsupported key types result in an error.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "PUBLIC KEY".

func ParseCRL(crlBytes []byte) (*pkix.CertificateList, error)
    ParseCRL parses a CRL from the given bytes. It's often the case that PEM
    encoded CRLs will appear where they should be DER encoded, so this function
    will transparently handle PEM encoding as long as there isn't any leading
    garbage.

    Deprecated: Use ParseRevocationList instead.

func ParseDERCRL(derBytes []byte) (*pkix.CertificateList, error)
    ParseDERCRL parses a DER encoded CRL from the given bytes.

    Deprecated: Use ParseRevocationList instead.

func ParseECPrivateKey(der []byte) (*ecdsa.PrivateKey, error)
    ParseECPrivateKey parses an EC private key in SEC 1, ASN.1 DER form.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "EC PRIVATE KEY".

func ParsePKCS1PrivateKey(der []byte) (*rsa.PrivateKey, error)
    ParsePKCS1PrivateKey parses an RSA private key in PKCS #1, ASN.1 DER form.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "RSA PRIVATE
    KEY".

    Before Go 1.24, the CRT parameters were ignored and recomputed. To restore
    the old behavior, use the GODEBUG=x509rsacrt=0 environment variable.

func ParsePKCS1PublicKey(der []byte) (*rsa.PublicKey, error)
    ParsePKCS1PublicKey parses an RSA public key in PKCS #1, ASN.1 DER form.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "RSA PUBLIC KEY".

func ParsePKCS8PrivateKey(der []byte) (key any, err error)
    ParsePKCS8PrivateKey parses an unencrypted private key in PKCS #8, ASN.1 DER
    form.

    It returns a *rsa.PrivateKey, an *ecdsa.PrivateKey, an ed25519.PrivateKey
    (not a pointer), or an *ecdh.PrivateKey (for X25519). More types might be
    supported in the future.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "PRIVATE KEY".

    Before Go 1.24, the CRT parameters of RSA keys were ignored and recomputed.
    To restore the old behavior, use the GODEBUG=x509rsacrt=0 environment
    variable.

func ParsePKIXPublicKey(derBytes []byte) (pub any, err error)
    ParsePKIXPublicKey parses a public key in PKIX, ASN.1 DER form. The encoded
    public key is a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure (see RFC 5280, Section 4.1).

    It returns a *rsa.PublicKey, *dsa.PublicKey, *ecdsa.PublicKey,
    ed25519.PublicKey (not a pointer), or *ecdh.PublicKey (for X25519). More
    types might be supported in the future.

    This kind of key is commonly encoded in PEM blocks of type "PUBLIC KEY".

func SetFallbackRoots(roots *CertPool)
    SetFallbackRoots sets the roots to use during certificate verification,
    if no custom roots are specified and a platform verifier or a system
    certificate pool is not available (for instance in a container which does
    not have a root certificate bundle). SetFallbackRoots will panic if roots is
    nil.

    SetFallbackRoots may only be called once, if called multiple times it will
    panic.

    The fallback behavior can be forced on all platforms, even when there
    is a system certificate pool, by setting GODEBUG=x509usefallbackroots=1
    (note that on Windows and macOS this will disable usage of the platform
    verification APIs and cause the pure Go verifier to be used). Setting
    x509usefallbackroots=1 without calling SetFallbackRoots has no effect.


TYPES

type CertPool struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    CertPool is a set of certificates.

func NewCertPool() *CertPool
    NewCertPool returns a new, empty CertPool.

func SystemCertPool() (*CertPool, error)
    SystemCertPool returns a copy of the system cert pool.

    On Unix systems other than macOS the environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE
    and SSL_CERT_DIR can be used to override the system default locations for
    the SSL certificate file and SSL certificate files directory, respectively.
    The latter can be a colon-separated list.

    Any mutations to the returned pool are not written to disk and do not affect
    any other pool returned by SystemCertPool.

    New changes in the system cert pool might not be reflected in subsequent
    calls.

func (s *CertPool) AddCert(cert *Certificate)
    AddCert adds a certificate to a pool.

func (s *CertPool) AddCertWithConstraint(cert *Certificate, constraint func([]*Certificate) error)
    AddCertWithConstraint adds a certificate to the pool with the additional
    constraint. When Certificate.Verify builds a chain which is rooted by cert,
    it will additionally pass the whole chain to constraint to determine
    its validity. If constraint returns a non-nil error, the chain will be
    discarded. constraint may be called concurrently from multiple goroutines.

func (s *CertPool) AppendCertsFromPEM(pemCerts []byte) (ok bool)
    AppendCertsFromPEM attempts to parse a series of PEM encoded certificates.
    It appends any certificates found to s and reports whether any certificates
    were successfully parsed.

    On many Linux systems, /etc/ssl/cert.pem will contain the system wide set of
    root CAs in a format suitable for this function.

func (s *CertPool) Clone() *CertPool
    Clone returns a copy of s.

func (s *CertPool) Equal(other *CertPool) bool
    Equal reports whether s and other are equal.

func (s *CertPool) Subjects() [][]byte
    Subjects returns a list of the DER-encoded subjects of all of the
    certificates in the pool.

    Deprecated: if s was returned by SystemCertPool, Subjects will not include
    the system roots.

}
    A Certificate represents an X.509 certificate.

func ParseCertificate(der []byte) (*Certificate, error)
    ParseCertificate parses a single certificate from the given ASN.1 DER data.

    Before Go 1.23, ParseCertificate accepted certificates with negative serial
    numbers. This behavior can be restored by including "x509negativeserial=1"
    in the GODEBUG environment variable.

func ParseCertificates(der []byte) ([]*Certificate, error)
    ParseCertificates parses one or more certificates from the given ASN.1 DER
    data. The certificates must be concatenated with no intermediate padding.

func (c *Certificate) CheckCRLSignature(crl *pkix.CertificateList) error
    CheckCRLSignature checks that the signature in crl is from c.

    Deprecated: Use RevocationList.CheckSignatureFrom instead.

func (c *Certificate) CheckSignature(algo SignatureAlgorithm, signed, signature []byte) error
    CheckSignature verifies that signature is a valid signature over signed from
    c's public key.

    This is a low-level API that performs no validity checks on the certificate.

    MD5WithRSA signatures are rejected, while SHA1WithRSA and ECDSAWithSHA1
    signatures are currently accepted.

func (c *Certificate) CheckSignatureFrom(parent *Certificate) error
    CheckSignatureFrom verifies that the signature on c is a valid signature
    from parent.

    This is a low-level API that performs very limited checks, and not a full
    path verifier. Most users should use Certificate.Verify instead.

func (c *Certificate) CreateCRL(rand io.Reader, priv any, revokedCerts []pkix.RevokedCertificate, now, expiry time.Time) (crlBytes []byte, err error)
    CreateCRL returns a DER encoded CRL, signed by this Certificate, that
    contains the given list of revoked certificates.

    Deprecated: this method does not generate an RFC 5280 conformant X.509
    v2 CRL. To generate a standards compliant CRL, use CreateRevocationList
    instead.

func (c *Certificate) Equal(other *Certificate) bool

func (c *Certificate) Verify(opts VerifyOptions) (chains [][]*Certificate, err error)
    Verify attempts to verify c by building one or more chains from c to a
    certificate in opts.Roots, using certificates in opts.Intermediates if
    needed. If successful, it returns one or more chains where the first element
    of the chain is c and the last element is from opts.Roots.

    If opts.Roots is nil, the platform verifier might be used, and verification
    details might differ from what is described below. If system roots are
    unavailable the returned error will be of type SystemRootsError.

    Name constraints in the intermediates will be applied to all names claimed
    in the chain, not just opts.DNSName. Thus it is invalid for a leaf to claim
    example.com if an intermediate doesn't permit it, even if example.com is
    not the name being validated. Note that DirectoryName constraints are not
    supported.

    Name constraint validation follows the rules from RFC 5280, with the
    addition that DNS name constraints may use the leading period format defined
    for emails and URIs. When a constraint has a leading period it indicates
    that at least one additional label must be prepended to the constrained name
    to be considered valid.

    Extended Key Usage values are enforced nested down a chain, so an
    intermediate or root that enumerates EKUs prevents a leaf from asserting an
    EKU not in that list. (While this is not specified, it is common practice in
    order to limit the types of certificates a CA can issue.)

    Certificates that use SHA1WithRSA and ECDSAWithSHA1 signatures are not
    supported, and will not be used to build chains.

    Certificates other than c in the returned chains should not be modified.

    WARNING: this function doesn't do any revocation checking.

func (c *Certificate) VerifyHostname(h string) error
    VerifyHostname returns nil if c is a valid certificate for the named host.
    Otherwise it returns an error describing the mismatch.

    IP addresses can be optionally enclosed in square brackets and are checked
    against the IPAddresses field. Other names are checked case insensitively
    against the DNSNames field. If the names are valid hostnames, the
    certificate fields can have a wildcard as the complete left-most label (e.g.
    *.example.com).

    Note that the legacy Common Name field is ignored.

type CertificateInvalidError struct {
	Cert   *Certificate
	Reason InvalidReason
	Detail string
}
    CertificateInvalidError results when an odd error occurs. Users of this
    library probably want to handle all these errors uniformly.
