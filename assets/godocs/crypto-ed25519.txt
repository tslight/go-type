package ed25519 // import "crypto/ed25519"

Package ed25519 implements the Ed25519 signature algorithm. See
https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/.

These functions are also compatible with the “Ed25519” function defined in
RFC 8032. However, unlike RFC 8032's formulation, this package's private key
representation includes a public key suffix to make multiple signing operations
with the same key more efficient. This package refers to the RFC 8032 private
key as the “seed”.

Operations involving private keys are implemented using constant-time
algorithms.

CONSTANTS

const (
	// PublicKeySize is the size, in bytes, of public keys as used in this package.
	PublicKeySize = 32
	// PrivateKeySize is the size, in bytes, of private keys as used in this package.
	PrivateKeySize = 64
	// SignatureSize is the size, in bytes, of signatures generated and verified by this package.
	SignatureSize = 64
	// SeedSize is the size, in bytes, of private key seeds. These are the private key representations used by RFC 8032.
	SeedSize = 32
)

FUNCTIONS

func GenerateKey(rand io.Reader) (PublicKey, PrivateKey, error)
    GenerateKey generates a public/private key pair using entropy from rand.
    If rand is nil, crypto/rand.Reader will be used.

    The output of this function is deterministic, and equivalent to reading
    SeedSize bytes from rand, and passing them to NewKeyFromSeed.

func Sign(privateKey PrivateKey, message []byte) []byte
    Sign signs the message with privateKey and returns a signature. It will
    panic if len(privateKey) is not PrivateKeySize.

func Verify(publicKey PublicKey, message, sig []byte) bool
    Verify reports whether sig is a valid signature of message by publicKey.
    It will panic if len(publicKey) is not PublicKeySize.

    The inputs are not considered confidential, and may leak through timing side
    channels, or if an attacker has control of part of the inputs.

func VerifyWithOptions(publicKey PublicKey, message, sig []byte, opts *Options) error
    VerifyWithOptions reports whether sig is a valid signature of message by
    publicKey. A valid signature is indicated by returning a nil error. It will
    panic if len(publicKey) is not PublicKeySize.

    If opts.Hash is crypto.SHA512, the pre-hashed variant Ed25519ph is used
    and message is expected to be a SHA-512 hash, otherwise opts.Hash must be
    crypto.Hash(0) and the message must not be hashed, as Ed25519 performs two
    passes over messages to be signed.

    The inputs are not considered confidential, and may leak through timing side
    channels, or if an attacker has control of part of the inputs.


TYPES

type Options struct {
	// Hash can be zero for regular Ed25519, or crypto.SHA512 for Ed25519ph.
	Hash crypto.Hash

	// Context, if not empty, selects Ed25519ctx or provides the context string
	// for Ed25519ph. It can be at most 255 bytes in length.
	Context string
}
    Options can be used with PrivateKey.Sign or VerifyWithOptions to select
    Ed25519 variants.

func (o *Options) HashFunc() crypto.Hash
    HashFunc returns o.Hash.

type PrivateKey []byte
    PrivateKey is the type of Ed25519 private keys. It implements crypto.Signer.

func NewKeyFromSeed(seed []byte) PrivateKey
    NewKeyFromSeed calculates a private key from a seed. It will panic if
    len(seed) is not SeedSize. This function is provided for interoperability
    with RFC 8032. RFC 8032's private keys correspond to seeds in this package.

func (priv PrivateKey) Equal(x crypto.PrivateKey) bool
    Equal reports whether priv and x have the same value.

func (priv PrivateKey) Public() crypto.PublicKey
    Public returns the PublicKey corresponding to priv.

func (priv PrivateKey) Seed() []byte
    Seed returns the private key seed corresponding to priv. It is provided for
    interoperability with RFC 8032. RFC 8032's private keys correspond to seeds
    in this package.

func (priv PrivateKey) Sign(rand io.Reader, message []byte, opts crypto.SignerOpts) (signature []byte, err error)
    Sign signs the given message with priv. rand is ignored and can be nil.

    If opts.HashFunc() is crypto.SHA512, the pre-hashed variant Ed25519ph is
    used and message is expected to be a SHA-512 hash, otherwise opts.HashFunc()
    must be crypto.Hash(0) and the message must not be hashed, as Ed25519
    performs two passes over messages to be signed.

    A value of type Options can be used as opts, or crypto.Hash(0) or
    crypto.SHA512 directly to select plain Ed25519 or Ed25519ph, respectively.

type PublicKey []byte
    PublicKey is the type of Ed25519 public keys.

func (pub PublicKey) Equal(x crypto.PublicKey) bool
    Equal reports whether pub and x have the same value.
