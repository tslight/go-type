package regexp // import "regexp"

Package regexp implements regular expression search.

The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the same general syntax
used by Perl, Python, and other languages. More precisely, it is the syntax
accepted by RE2 and described at https://golang.org/s/re2syntax, except for \C.
For an overview of the syntax, see the regexp/syntax package.

The regexp implementation provided by this package is guaranteed to run in time
linear in the size of the input. (This is a property not guaranteed by most
open source implementations of regular expressions.) For more information about
this property, see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html or any book about
automata theory.

All characters are UTF-8-encoded code points. Following utf8.DecodeRune, each
byte of an invalid UTF-8 sequence is treated as if it encoded utf8.RuneError
(U+FFFD).

There are 16 methods of Regexp that match a regular expression and identify the
matched text. Their names are matched by this regular expression:

    Find(All)?(String)?(Submatch)?(Index)?

If 'All' is present, the routine matches successive non-overlapping matches of
the entire expression. Empty matches abutting a preceding match are ignored.
The return value is a slice containing the successive return values of the
corresponding non-'All' routine. These routines take an extra integer argument,
n. If n >= 0, the function returns at most n matches/submatches; otherwise,
it returns all of them.

If 'String' is present, the argument is a string; otherwise it is a slice of
bytes; return values are adjusted as appropriate.

If 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the
successive submatches of the expression. Submatches are matches of parenthesized
subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the regular expression,
numbered from left to right in order of opening parenthesis. Submatch 0 is
the match of the entire expression, submatch 1 is the match of the first
parenthesized subexpression, and so on.

If 'Index' is present, matches and submatches are identified by byte index
pairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes
of the nth submatch. The pair for n==0 identifies the match of the entire
expression. If 'Index' is not present, the match is identified by the text
of the match/submatch. If an index is negative or text is nil, it means that
subexpression did not match any string in the input. For 'String' versions an
empty string means either no match or an empty match.

There is also a subset of the methods that can be applied to text read
from an io.RuneReader: Regexp.MatchReader, Regexp.FindReaderIndex,
Regexp.FindReaderSubmatchIndex.

This set may grow. Note that regular expression matches may need to examine
text beyond the text returned by a match, so the methods that match text from an
io.RuneReader may read arbitrarily far into the input before returning.

(There are a few other methods that do not match this pattern.)

func Match(pattern string, b []byte) (matched bool, err error)
func MatchReader(pattern string, r io.RuneReader) (matched bool, err error)
func MatchString(pattern string, s string) (matched bool, err error)
func QuoteMeta(s string) string
type Regexp struct{ ... }
    func Compile(expr string) (*Regexp, error)
    func CompilePOSIX(expr string) (*Regexp, error)
    func MustCompile(str string) *Regexp
    func MustCompilePOSIX(str string) *Regexp
