package gzip // import "compress/gzip"

Package gzip implements reading and writing of gzip format compressed files,
as specified in RFC 1952.

CONSTANTS

const (
	NoCompression      = flate.NoCompression
	BestSpeed          = flate.BestSpeed
	BestCompression    = flate.BestCompression
	DefaultCompression = flate.DefaultCompression
	HuffmanOnly        = flate.HuffmanOnly
)
    These constants are copied from the flate package, so that code that imports
    compress/gzip does not also have to import compress/flate.


VARIABLES

var (
	// ErrChecksum is returned when reading GZIP data that has an invalid checksum.
	ErrChecksum = errors.New("gzip: invalid checksum")
	// ErrHeader is returned when reading GZIP data that has an invalid header.
	ErrHeader = errors.New("gzip: invalid header")
)

TYPES

type Header struct {
	Comment string    // comment
	Extra   []byte    // "extra data"
	ModTime time.Time // modification time
	Name    string    // file name
	OS      byte      // operating system type
}
    The gzip file stores a header giving metadata about the compressed file.
    That header is exposed as the fields of the Writer and Reader structs.

    Strings must be UTF-8 encoded and may only contain Unicode code points
    U+0001 through U+00FF, due to limitations of the GZIP file format.

type Reader struct {
	Header // valid after NewReader or Reader.Reset

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Reader is an io.Reader that can be read to retrieve uncompressed data from
    a gzip-format compressed file.

    In general, a gzip file can be a concatenation of gzip files, each with
    its own header. Reads from the Reader return the concatenation of the
    uncompressed data of each. Only the first header is recorded in the Reader
    fields.

    Gzip files store a length and checksum of the uncompressed data.
    The Reader will return an ErrChecksum when Reader.Read reaches the end of
    the uncompressed data if it does not have the expected length or checksum.
    Clients should treat data returned by Reader.Read as tentative until they
    receive the io.EOF marking the end of the data.

func NewReader(r io.Reader) (*Reader, error)
    NewReader creates a new Reader reading the given reader. If r does not also
    implement io.ByteReader, the decompressor may read more data than necessary
    from r.

    It is the caller's responsibility to call Reader.Close when done.

    The Reader.Header fields will be valid in the Reader returned.

func (z *Reader) Close() error
    Close closes the Reader. It does not close the underlying reader. In order
    for the GZIP checksum to be verified, the reader must be fully consumed
    until the io.EOF.

func (z *Reader) Multistream(ok bool)
    Multistream controls whether the reader supports multistream files.

    If enabled (the default), the Reader expects the input to be a sequence of
    individually gzipped data streams, each with its own header and trailer,
    ending at EOF. The effect is that the concatenation of a sequence of gzipped
    files is treated as equivalent to the gzip of the concatenation of the
    sequence. This is standard behavior for gzip readers.

    Calling Multistream(false) disables this behavior; disabling the behavior
    can be useful when reading file formats that distinguish individual gzip
    data streams or mix gzip data streams with other data streams. In this mode,
    when the Reader reaches the end of the data stream, Reader.Read returns
    io.EOF. The underlying reader must implement io.ByteReader in order to be
    left positioned just after the gzip stream. To start the next stream, call
    z.Reset(r) followed by z.Multistream(false). If there is no next stream,
    z.Reset(r) will return io.EOF.

func (z *Reader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    Read implements io.Reader, reading uncompressed bytes from its underlying
    reader.

func (z *Reader) Reset(r io.Reader) error
    Reset discards the Reader z's state and makes it equivalent to the result of
    its original state from NewReader, but reading from r instead. This permits
    reusing a Reader rather than allocating a new one.

type Writer struct {
	Header // written at first call to Write, Flush, or Close

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Writer is an io.WriteCloser. Writes to a Writer are compressed and written
    to w.

func NewWriter(w io.Writer) *Writer
    NewWriter returns a new Writer. Writes to the returned writer are compressed
    and written to w.

    It is the caller's responsibility to call Close on the Writer when done.
    Writes may be buffered and not flushed until Close.

    Callers that wish to set the fields in Writer.Header must do so before the
    first call to Write, Flush, or Close.

func NewWriterLevel(w io.Writer, level int) (*Writer, error)
    NewWriterLevel is like NewWriter but specifies the compression level instead
    of assuming DefaultCompression.

    The compression level can be DefaultCompression, NoCompression, HuffmanOnly
    or any integer value between BestSpeed and BestCompression inclusive.
    The error returned will be nil if the level is valid.

func (z *Writer) Close() error
    Close closes the Writer by flushing any unwritten data to the underlying
    io.Writer and writing the GZIP footer. It does not close the underlying
    io.Writer.

func (z *Writer) Flush() error
    Flush flushes any pending compressed data to the underlying writer.

    It is useful mainly in compressed network protocols, to ensure that a remote
    reader has enough data to reconstruct a packet. Flush does not return until
    the data has been written. If the underlying writer returns an error,
    Flush returns that error.

    In the terminology of the zlib library, Flush is equivalent to Z_SYNC_FLUSH.

func (z *Writer) Reset(w io.Writer)
    Reset discards the Writer z's state and makes it equivalent to the result
    of its original state from NewWriter or NewWriterLevel, but writing to w
    instead. This permits reusing a Writer rather than allocating a new one.

func (z *Writer) Write(p []byte) (int, error)
    Write writes a compressed form of p to the underlying io.Writer. The
    compressed bytes are not necessarily flushed until the Writer is closed.
