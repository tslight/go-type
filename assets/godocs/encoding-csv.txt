package csv // import "encoding/csv"

Package csv reads and writes comma-separated values (CSV) files. There are many
kinds of CSV files; this package supports the format described in RFC 4180,
except that Writer uses LF instead of CRLF as newline character by default.

A csv file contains zero or more records of one or more fields per record. Each
record is separated by the newline character. The final record may optionally be
followed by a newline character.

    field1,field2,field3

White space is considered part of a field.

Carriage returns before newline characters are silently removed.

Blank lines are ignored. A line with only whitespace characters (excluding the
ending newline character) is not considered a blank line.

Fields which start and stop with the quote character " are called quoted-fields.
The beginning and ending quote are not part of the field.

The source:

    normal string,"quoted-field"

results in the fields

    {`normal string`, `quoted-field`}

Within a quoted-field a quote character followed by a second quote character is
considered a single quote.

    "the ""word"" is true","a ""quoted-field"""

results in

    {`the "word" is true`, `a "quoted-field"`}

Newlines and commas may be included in a quoted-field

    "Multi-line
    field","comma is ,"

results in

    {`Multi-line
    field`, `comma is ,`}

VARIABLES

var (
	ErrBareQuote  = errors.New("bare \" in non-quoted-field")
	ErrQuote      = errors.New("extraneous or missing \" in quoted-field")
	ErrFieldCount = errors.New("wrong number of fields")

	// Deprecated: ErrTrailingComma is no longer used.
	ErrTrailingComma = errors.New("extra delimiter at end of line")
)
    These are the errors that can be returned in [ParseError.Err].


TYPES

type ParseError struct {
	StartLine int   // Line where the record starts
	Line      int   // Line where the error occurred
	Column    int   // Column (1-based byte index) where the error occurred
	Err       error // The actual error
}
    A ParseError is returned for parsing errors. Line and column numbers are
    1-indexed.

func (e *ParseError) Error() string

func (e *ParseError) Unwrap() error

type Reader struct {
	// Comma is the field delimiter.
	// It is set to comma (',') by NewReader.
	// Comma must be a valid rune and must not be \r, \n,
	// or the Unicode replacement character (0xFFFD).
	Comma rune

	// Comment, if not 0, is the comment character. Lines beginning with the
	// Comment character without preceding whitespace are ignored.
	// With leading whitespace the Comment character becomes part of the
	// field, even if TrimLeadingSpace is true.
	// Comment must be a valid rune and must not be \r, \n,
	// or the Unicode replacement character (0xFFFD).
	// It must also not be equal to Comma.
	Comment rune

	// FieldsPerRecord is the number of expected fields per record.
	// If FieldsPerRecord is positive, Read requires each record to
	// have the given number of fields. If FieldsPerRecord is 0, Read sets it to
	// the number of fields in the first record, so that future records must
	// have the same field count. If FieldsPerRecord is negative, no check is
	// made and records may have a variable number of fields.
	FieldsPerRecord int

	// If LazyQuotes is true, a quote may appear in an unquoted field and a
	// non-doubled quote may appear in a quoted field.
	LazyQuotes bool

	// If TrimLeadingSpace is true, leading white space in a field is ignored.
	// This is done even if the field delimiter, Comma, is white space.
	TrimLeadingSpace bool

	// ReuseRecord controls whether calls to Read may return a slice sharing
	// the backing array of the previous call's returned slice for performance.
	// By default, each call to Read returns newly allocated memory owned by the caller.
	ReuseRecord bool

	// Deprecated: TrailingComma is no longer used.
	TrailingComma bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Reader reads records from a CSV-encoded file.

    As returned by NewReader, a Reader expects input conforming to RFC 4180.
    The exported fields can be changed to customize the details before the first
    call to Reader.Read or Reader.ReadAll.

    The Reader converts all \r\n sequences in its input to plain \n, including
    in multiline field values, so that the returned data does not depend on
    which line-ending convention an input file uses.

func NewReader(r io.Reader) *Reader
    NewReader returns a new Reader that reads from r.

func (r *Reader) FieldPos(field int) (line, column int)
    FieldPos returns the line and column corresponding to the start of the field
    with the given index in the slice most recently returned by Reader.Read.
    Numbering of lines and columns starts at 1; columns are counted in bytes,
    not runes.

    If this is called with an out-of-bounds index, it panics.

func (r *Reader) InputOffset() int64
    InputOffset returns the input stream byte offset of the current reader
    position. The offset gives the location of the end of the most recently read
    row and the beginning of the next row.

func (r *Reader) Read() (record []string, err error)
    Read reads one record (a slice of fields) from r. If the record has an
    unexpected number of fields, Read returns the record along with the error
    ErrFieldCount. If the record contains a field that cannot be parsed,
    Read returns a partial record along with the parse error. The partial
    record contains all fields read before the error. If there is no data left
    to be read, Read returns nil, io.EOF. If [Reader.ReuseRecord] is true,
    the returned slice may be shared between multiple calls to Read.

func (r *Reader) ReadAll() (records [][]string, err error)
    ReadAll reads all the remaining records from r. Each record is a slice of
    fields. A successful call returns err == nil, not err == io.EOF. Because
    ReadAll is defined to read until EOF, it does not treat end of file as an
    error to be reported.

type Writer struct {
	Comma   rune // Field delimiter (set to ',' by NewWriter)
	UseCRLF bool // True to use \r\n as the line terminator
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Writer writes records using CSV encoding.

    As returned by NewWriter, a Writer writes records terminated by a
    newline and uses ',' as the field delimiter. The exported fields can be
    changed to customize the details before the first call to Writer.Write or
    Writer.WriteAll.

    [Writer.Comma] is the field delimiter.

    If [Writer.UseCRLF] is true, the Writer ends each output line with \r\n
    instead of \n.

    The writes of individual records are buffered. After all data has been
    written, the client should call the Writer.Flush method to guarantee
    all data has been forwarded to the underlying io.Writer. Any errors that
    occurred should be checked by calling the Writer.Error method.

func NewWriter(w io.Writer) *Writer
    NewWriter returns a new Writer that writes to w.

func (w *Writer) Error() error
    Error reports any error that has occurred during a previous Writer.Write or
    Writer.Flush.

func (w *Writer) Flush()
    Flush writes any buffered data to the underlying io.Writer. To check if an
    error occurred during Flush, call Writer.Error.

func (w *Writer) Write(record []string) error
    Write writes a single CSV record to w along with any necessary quoting.
    A record is a slice of strings with each string being one field. Writes
    are buffered, so Writer.Flush must eventually be called to ensure that the
    record is written to the underlying io.Writer.

func (w *Writer) WriteAll(records [][]string) error
    WriteAll writes multiple CSV records to w using Writer.Write and then calls
    Writer.Flush, returning any error from the Flush.
