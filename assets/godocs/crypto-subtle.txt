package subtle // import "crypto/subtle"

Package subtle implements functions that are often useful in cryptographic code
but require careful thought to use correctly.

FUNCTIONS

func ConstantTimeByteEq(x, y uint8) int
    ConstantTimeByteEq returns 1 if x == y and 0 otherwise.

func ConstantTimeCompare(x, y []byte) int
    ConstantTimeCompare returns 1 if the two slices, x and y, have equal
    contents and 0 otherwise. The time taken is a function of the length of the
    slices and is independent of the contents. If the lengths of x and y do not
    match it returns 0 immediately.

func ConstantTimeCopy(v int, x, y []byte)
    ConstantTimeCopy copies the contents of y into x (a slice of equal length)
    if v == 1. If v == 0, x is left unchanged. Its behavior is undefined if v
    takes any other value.

func ConstantTimeEq(x, y int32) int
    ConstantTimeEq returns 1 if x == y and 0 otherwise.

func ConstantTimeLessOrEq(x, y int) int
    ConstantTimeLessOrEq returns 1 if x <= y and 0 otherwise. Its behavior is
    undefined if x or y are negative or > 2**31 - 1.

func ConstantTimeSelect(v, x, y int) int
    ConstantTimeSelect returns x if v == 1 and y if v == 0. Its behavior is
    undefined if v takes any other value.

func WithDataIndependentTiming(f func())
    WithDataIndependentTiming enables architecture specific features which
    ensure that the timing of specific instructions is independent of their
    inputs before executing f. On f returning it disables these features.

    WithDataIndependentTiming should only be used when f is written to make
    use of constant-time operations. WithDataIndependentTiming does not make
    variable-time code constant-time.

    WithDataIndependentTiming may lock the current goroutine to the OS thread
    for the duration of f. Calls to WithDataIndependentTiming may be nested.

    On Arm64 processors with FEAT_DIT,
    WithDataIndependentTiming enables PSTATE.DIT. See
    https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka005181/1-0/?lang=en.

    Currently, on all other architectures WithDataIndependentTiming executes f
    immediately with no other side-effects.

func XORBytes(dst, x, y []byte) int
    XORBytes sets dst[i] = x[i] ^ y[i] for all i < n = min(len(x), len(y)),
    returning n, the number of bytes written to dst.

    If dst does not have length at least n, XORBytes panics without writing
    anything to dst.

    dst and x or y may overlap exactly or not at all, otherwise XORBytes may
    panic.
