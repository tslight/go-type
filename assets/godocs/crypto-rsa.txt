package rsa // import "crypto/rsa"

Package rsa implements RSA encryption as specified in PKCS #1 and RFC 8017.

RSA is a single, fundamental operation that is used in this package to implement
either public-key encryption or public-key signatures.

The original specification for encryption and signatures with RSA is PKCS #1
and the terms "RSA encryption" and "RSA signatures" by default refer to PKCS #1
version 1.5. However, that specification has flaws and new designs should use
version 2, usually called by just OAEP and PSS, where possible.

Two sets of interfaces are included in this package. When a more abstract
interface isn't necessary, there are functions for encrypting/decrypting with
v1.5/OAEP and signing/verifying with v1.5/PSS. If one needs to abstract over the
public key primitive, the PrivateKey type implements the Decrypter and Signer
interfaces from the crypto package.

Operations involving private keys are implemented using constant-time
algorithms, except for GenerateKey and for some operations involving deprecated
multi-prime keys.

# Minimum key size

GenerateKey returns an error if a key of less than 1024 bits is requested,
and all Sign, Verify, Encrypt, and Decrypt methods return an error if used with
a key smaller than 1024 bits. Such keys are insecure and should not be used.

The rsa1024min=0 GODEBUG setting suppresses this error, but we recommend doing
so only in tests, if necessary. Tests can set this option using testing.T.Setenv
or by including "//go:debug rsa1024min=0" in a *_test.go source file.

Alternatively, see the GenerateKey (TestKey) example for a pregenerated
test-only 2048-bit key.

CONSTANTS

const (
	// PSSSaltLengthAuto causes the salt in a PSS signature to be as large
	// as possible when signing, and to be auto-detected when verifying.
	//
	// When signing in FIPS 140-3 mode, the salt length is capped at the length
	// of the hash function used in the signature.
	PSSSaltLengthAuto = 0
	// PSSSaltLengthEqualsHash causes the salt length to equal the length
	// of the hash used in the signature.
	PSSSaltLengthEqualsHash = -1
)

VARIABLES

var ErrDecryption = errors.New("crypto/rsa: decryption error")
    ErrDecryption represents a failure to decrypt a message. It is deliberately
    vague to avoid adaptive attacks.

var ErrMessageTooLong = errors.New("crypto/rsa: message too long for RSA key size")
    ErrMessageTooLong is returned when attempting to encrypt or sign a message
    which is too large for the size of the key. When using SignPSS, this can
    also be returned if the size of the salt is too large.

var ErrVerification = errors.New("crypto/rsa: verification error")
    ErrVerification represents a failure to verify a signature. It is
    deliberately vague to avoid adaptive attacks.


FUNCTIONS

func DecryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, random io.Reader, priv *PrivateKey, ciphertext []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error)
    DecryptOAEP decrypts ciphertext using RSA-OAEP.

    OAEP is parameterised by a hash function that is used as a random oracle.
    Encryption and decryption of a given message must use the same hash function
    and sha256.New() is a reasonable choice.

    The random parameter is legacy and ignored, and it can be nil.

    The label parameter must match the value given when encrypting. See
    EncryptOAEP for details.

func DecryptPKCS1v15(random io.Reader, priv *PrivateKey, ciphertext []byte) ([]byte, error)
    DecryptPKCS1v15 decrypts a plaintext using RSA and the padding scheme from
    PKCS #1 v1.5. The random parameter is legacy and ignored, and it can be nil.

    Note that whether this function returns an error or not discloses
    secret information. If an attacker can cause this function to run
    repeatedly and learn whether each instance returned an error then they
    can decrypt and forge signatures as if they had the private key. See
    DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey for a way of solving this problem.

func DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey(random io.Reader, priv *PrivateKey, ciphertext []byte, key []byte) error
    DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey decrypts a session key using RSA and the padding
    scheme from PKCS #1 v1.5. The random parameter is legacy and ignored,
    and it can be nil.

    DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey returns an error if the ciphertext is the wrong
    length or if the ciphertext is greater than the public modulus. Otherwise,
    no error is returned. If the padding is valid, the resulting plaintext
    message is copied into key. Otherwise, key is unchanged. These alternatives
    occur in constant time. It is intended that the user of this function
    generate a random session key beforehand and continue the protocol with the
    resulting value.

    Note that if the session key is too small then it may be possible for an
    attacker to brute-force it. If they can do that then they can learn whether
    a random value was used (because it'll be different for the same ciphertext)
    and thus whether the padding was correct. This also defeats the point of
    this function. Using at least a 16-byte key will protect against this
    attack.

    This method implements protections against Bleichenbacher chosen ciphertext
    attacks [0] described in RFC 3218 Section 2.3.2 [1]. While these
    protections make a Bleichenbacher attack significantly more difficult,
    the protections are only effective if the rest of the protocol which uses
    DecryptPKCS1v15SessionKey is designed with these considerations in mind. In
    particular, if any subsequent operations which use the decrypted session key
    leak any information about the key (e.g. whether it is a static or random
    key) then the mitigations are defeated. This method must be used extremely
    carefully, and typically should only be used when absolutely necessary for
    compatibility with an existing protocol (such as TLS) that is designed with
    these properties in mind.

func EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error)
    EncryptOAEP encrypts the given message with RSA-OAEP.

    OAEP is parameterised by a hash function that is used as a random oracle.
    Encryption and decryption of a given message must use the same hash function
    and sha256.New() is a reasonable choice.

    The random parameter is used as a source of entropy to ensure that
    encrypting the same message twice doesn't result in the same ciphertext.
    Most applications should use crypto/rand.Reader as random.

    The label parameter may contain arbitrary data that will not be encrypted,
    but which gives important context to the message. For example, if a given
    public key is used to encrypt two types of messages then distinct label
    values could be used to ensure that a ciphertext for one purpose cannot be
    used for another by an attacker. If not required it can be empty.

    The message must be no longer than the length of the public modulus minus
    twice the hash length, minus a further 2.

func EncryptPKCS1v15(random io.Reader, pub *PublicKey, msg []byte) ([]byte, error)
    EncryptPKCS1v15 encrypts the given message with RSA and the padding scheme
    from PKCS #1 v1.5. The message must be no longer than the length of the
    public modulus minus 11 bytes.

    The random parameter is used as a source of entropy to ensure that
    encrypting the same message twice doesn't result in the same ciphertext.
    Most applications should use crypto/rand.Reader as random. Note that the
    returned ciphertext does not depend deterministically on the bytes read from
    random, and may change between calls and/or between versions.

    WARNING: use of this function to encrypt plaintexts other than session keys
    is dangerous. Use RSA OAEP in new protocols.

func SignPKCS1v15(random io.Reader, priv *PrivateKey, hash crypto.Hash, hashed []byte) ([]byte, error)
    SignPKCS1v15 calculates the signature of hashed using RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5-SIGN
    from RSA PKCS #1 v1.5. Note that hashed must be the result of hashing the
    input message using the given hash function. If hash is zero, hashed is
    signed directly. This isn't advisable except for interoperability.

    The random parameter is legacy and ignored, and it can be nil.

    This function is deterministic. Thus, if the set of possible messages is
    small, an attacker may be able to build a map from messages to signatures
    and identify the signed messages. As ever, signatures provide authenticity,
    not confidentiality.

func SignPSS(rand io.Reader, priv *PrivateKey, hash crypto.Hash, digest []byte, opts *PSSOptions) ([]byte, error)
    SignPSS calculates the signature of digest using PSS.

    digest must be the result of hashing the input message using the given hash
    function. The opts argument may be nil, in which case sensible defaults are
    used. If opts.Hash is set, it overrides hash.

    The signature is randomized depending on the message, key, and salt size,
    using bytes from rand. Most applications should use crypto/rand.Reader as
    rand.

func VerifyPKCS1v15(pub *PublicKey, hash crypto.Hash, hashed []byte, sig []byte) error
    VerifyPKCS1v15 verifies an RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 signature. hashed is the result
    of hashing the input message using the given hash function and sig is
    the signature. A valid signature is indicated by returning a nil error.
    If hash is zero then hashed is used directly. This isn't advisable except
    for interoperability.

    The inputs are not considered confidential, and may leak through timing side
    channels, or if an attacker has control of part of the inputs.

func VerifyPSS(pub *PublicKey, hash crypto.Hash, digest []byte, sig []byte, opts *PSSOptions) error
    VerifyPSS verifies a PSS signature.

    A valid signature is indicated by returning a nil error. digest must be
    the result of hashing the input message using the given hash function.
    The opts argument may be nil, in which case sensible defaults are used.
    opts.Hash is ignored.

    The inputs are not considered confidential, and may leak through timing side
    channels, or if an attacker has control of part of the inputs.

    crypto.Decrypter interface.

type PKCS1v15DecryptOptions struct {
	// SessionKeyLen is the length of the session key that is being

    PKCS1v15DecryptOptions is for passing options to PKCS #1 v1.5 decryption
    using the crypto.Decrypter interface.

func GenerateKey(random io.Reader, bits int) (*PrivateKey, error)
    GenerateKey generates a random RSA private key of the given bit size.

    If bits is less than 1024, GenerateKey returns an error. See the "Minimum
    key size" section for further details.

    Most applications should use crypto/rand.Reader as rand. Note that the
    returned key does not depend deterministically on the bytes read from rand,
    and may change between calls and/or between versions.

[Minimum key size]: https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rsa#hdr-Minimum_key_size

func GenerateMultiPrimeKey(random io.Reader, nprimes int, bits int) (*PrivateKey, error)
    GenerateMultiPrimeKey generates a multi-prime RSA keypair of the given bit
    size and the given random source.

    Table 1 in "On the Security of Multi-prime RSA" suggests maximum numbers of
    primes for a given bit size.

    Although the public keys are compatible (actually, indistinguishable) from
    the 2-prime case, the private keys are not. Thus it may not be possible to
    export multi-prime private keys in certain formats or to subsequently import
    them into other code.

    This package does not implement CRT optimizations for multi-prime RSA,
    so the keys with more than two primes will have worse performance.

    Deprecated: The use of this function with a number of primes different
    from two is not recommended for the above security, compatibility, and
    performance reasons. Use GenerateKey instead.

func (priv *PrivateKey) Decrypt(rand io.Reader, ciphertext []byte, opts crypto.DecrypterOpts) (plaintext []byte, err error)
    Decrypt decrypts ciphertext with priv. If opts is nil or of type
    *PKCS1v15DecryptOptions then PKCS #1 v1.5 decryption is performed. Otherwise
    opts must have type *OAEPOptions and OAEP decryption is done.

func (priv *PrivateKey) Equal(x crypto.PrivateKey) bool
    Equal reports whether priv and x have equivalent values. It ignores
    Precomputed values.

func (priv *PrivateKey) Precompute()
    Precompute performs some calculations that speed up private key operations
    in the future. It is safe to run on non-validated private keys.

func (priv *PrivateKey) Public() crypto.PublicKey
    Public returns the public key corresponding to priv.

func (priv *PrivateKey) Sign(rand io.Reader, digest []byte, opts crypto.SignerOpts) ([]byte, error)
    Sign signs digest with priv, reading randomness from rand. If opts is a
    *PSSOptions then the PSS algorithm will be used, otherwise PKCS #1 v1.5
    will be used. digest must be the result of hashing the input message using
    opts.HashFunc().

    This method implements crypto.Signer, which is an interface to support
    keys where the private part is kept in, for example, a hardware module.
    Common uses should use the Sign* functions in this package directly.

func (priv *PrivateKey) Validate() error
    Validate performs basic sanity checks on the key. It returns nil if the key
    is valid, or else an error describing a problem.

    It runs faster on valid keys if run after PrivateKey.Precompute.

type PublicKey struct {
	N *big.Int // modulus
	E int      // public exponent
}
    A PublicKey represents the public part of an RSA key.

    The values of N and E are not considered confidential, and may leak through
    side channels, or could be mathematically derived from other public values.

func (pub *PublicKey) Equal(x crypto.PublicKey) bool
    Equal reports whether pub and x have the same value.

func (pub *PublicKey) Size() int
    Size returns the modulus size in bytes. Raw signatures and ciphertexts for
    or by this public key will have the same size.
