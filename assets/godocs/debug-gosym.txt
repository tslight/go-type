package gosym // import "debug/gosym"

Package gosym implements access to the Go symbol and line number tables embedded
in Go binaries generated by the gc compilers.

TYPES

type DecodingError struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    DecodingError represents an error during the decoding of the symbol table.

func (e *DecodingError) Error() string

type Func struct {
	Entry uint64
	*Sym
	End       uint64
	Params    []*Sym // nil for Go 1.3 and later binaries
	Locals    []*Sym // nil for Go 1.3 and later binaries
	FrameSize int
	LineTable *LineTable
	Obj       *Obj
}
    A Func collects information about a single function.

type LineTable struct {
	Data []byte
	PC   uint64
	Line int

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A LineTable is a data structure mapping program counters to line numbers.

    In Go 1.1 and earlier, each function (represented by a Func) had its own
    LineTable, and the line number corresponded to a numbering of all source
    lines in the program, across all files. That absolute line number would then
    have to be converted separately to a file name and line number within the
    file.

    In Go 1.2, the format of the data changed so that there is a single
    LineTable for the entire program, shared by all Funcs, and there are no
    absolute line numbers, just line numbers within specific files.

    For the most part, LineTable's methods should be treated as an internal
    detail of the package; callers should use the methods on Table instead.

func NewLineTable(data []byte, text uint64) *LineTable
    NewLineTable returns a new PC/line table corresponding to the encoded data.
    Text must be the start address of the corresponding text segment, with the
    exact value stored in the 'runtime.text' symbol. This value may differ from
    the start address of the text segment if binary was built with cgo enabled.

func (t *LineTable) LineToPC(line int, maxpc uint64) uint64
    LineToPC returns the program counter for the given line number, considering
    only program counters before maxpc.

    Deprecated: Use Table's LineToPC method instead.

func (t *LineTable) PCToLine(pc uint64) int
    PCToLine returns the line number for the given program counter.

    Deprecated: Use Table's PCToLine method instead.

type Obj struct {
	// Funcs is a list of functions in the Obj.
	Funcs []Func

	// In Go 1.1 and earlier, Paths is a list of symbols corresponding
	// to the source file names that produced the Obj.
	// In Go 1.2, Paths is nil.
	// Use the keys of Table.Files to obtain a list of source files.
	Paths []Sym // meta
}
    An Obj represents a collection of functions in a symbol table.

    The exact method of division of a binary into separate Objs is an internal
    detail of the symbol table format.

    In early versions of Go each source file became a different Obj.

    In Go 1 and Go 1.1, each package produced one Obj for all Go sources and one
    Obj per C source file.

    In Go 1.2, there is a single Obj for the entire program.

type Sym struct {
	Value  uint64
	Type   byte
	Name   string
	GoType uint64
	// If this symbol is a function symbol, the corresponding Func
	Func *Func

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Sym represents a single symbol table entry.

func (s *Sym) BaseName() string
    BaseName returns the symbol name without the package or receiver name.

func (s *Sym) PackageName() string
    PackageName returns the package part of the symbol name, or the empty string
    if there is none.

func (s *Sym) ReceiverName() string
    ReceiverName returns the receiver type name of this symbol, or the empty
    string if there is none. A receiver name is only detected in the case that
    s.Name is fully-specified with a package name.

func (s *Sym) Static() bool
    Static reports whether this symbol is static (not visible outside its file).

type Table struct {
	Syms  []Sym // nil for Go 1.3 and later binaries
	Funcs []Func
	Files map[string]*Obj // for Go 1.2 and later all files map to one Obj
	Objs  []Obj           // for Go 1.2 and later only one Obj in slice

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Table represents a Go symbol table. It stores all of the symbols decoded
    from the program and provides methods to translate between symbols, names,
    and addresses.

func NewTable(symtab []byte, pcln *LineTable) (*Table, error)
    NewTable decodes the Go symbol table (the ".gosymtab" section in ELF),
    returning an in-memory representation. Starting with Go 1.3, the Go symbol
    table no longer includes symbol data.

func (t *Table) LineToPC(file string, line int) (pc uint64, fn *Func, err error)
    LineToPC looks up the first program counter on the given line in the named
    file. It returns UnknownFileError or UnknownLineError if there is an error
    looking up this line.

func (t *Table) LookupFunc(name string) *Func
    LookupFunc returns the text, data, or bss symbol with the given name,
    or nil if no such symbol is found.

func (t *Table) LookupSym(name string) *Sym
    LookupSym returns the text, data, or bss symbol with the given name,
    or nil if no such symbol is found.

func (t *Table) PCToFunc(pc uint64) *Func
    PCToFunc returns the function containing the program counter pc, or nil if
    there is no such function.

func (t *Table) PCToLine(pc uint64) (file string, line int, fn *Func)
    PCToLine looks up line number information for a program counter. If there is
    no information, it returns fn == nil.

func (t *Table) SymByAddr(addr uint64) *Sym
    SymByAddr returns the text, data, or bss symbol starting at the given
    address.

type UnknownFileError string
    UnknownFileError represents a failure to find the specific file in the
    symbol table.

func (e UnknownFileError) Error() string

type UnknownLineError struct {
	File string
	Line int
}
    UnknownLineError represents a failure to map a line to a program counter,
    either because the line is beyond the bounds of the file or because there is
    no code on the given line.

func (e *UnknownLineError) Error() string
