package tls // import "crypto/tls"

Package tls partially implements TLS 1.2, as specified in RFC 5246, and TLS 1.3,
as specified in RFC 8446.

# FIPS 140-3 mode

When the program is in FIPS 140-3 mode, this package behaves as if only
SP 800-140C and SP 800-140D approved protocol versions, cipher suites,
signature algorithms, certificate public key types and sizes, and key exchange
and derivation algorithms were implemented. Others are silently ignored and not
negotiated, or rejected. This set may depend on the algorithms supported by
the FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module selected with GOFIPS140, and may change
across Go versions.

FUNCTIONS

func CipherSuiteName(id uint16) string
    CipherSuiteName returns the standard name for the passed cipher suite
    ID (e.g. "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"), or a fallback
    representation of the ID value if the cipher suite is not implemented by
    this package.

func Listen(network, laddr string, config *Config) (net.Listener, error)
    Listen creates a TLS listener accepting connections on the given network
    address using net.Listen. The configuration config must be non-nil and must
    include at least one certificate or else set GetCertificate.

func NewListener(inner net.Listener, config *Config) net.Listener
    NewListener creates a Listener which accepts connections from an inner
    Listener and wraps each connection with Server. The configuration config
    must be non-nil and must include at least one certificate or else set
    GetCertificate.

func VersionName(version uint16) string
    VersionName returns the name for the provided TLS version number (e.g.
    "TLS 1.3"), or a fallback representation of the value if the version is not
    implemented by this package.


TYPES

type AlertError uint8
    An AlertError is a TLS alert.

    When using a QUIC transport, QUICConn methods will return an error which
    wraps AlertError rather than sending a TLS alert.

func (e AlertError) Error() string

type Certificate struct {
	Certificate [][]byte
	// PrivateKey contains the private key corresponding to the public key in
	// Leaf. This must implement crypto.Signer with an RSA, ECDSA or Ed25519 PublicKey.
	// For a server up to TLS 1.2, it can also implement crypto.Decrypter with
	// an RSA PublicKey.
	PrivateKey crypto.PrivateKey
	// SupportedSignatureAlgorithms is an optional list restricting what
	// signature algorithms the PrivateKey can be used for.
	SupportedSignatureAlgorithms []SignatureScheme
	// OCSPStaple contains an optional OCSP response which will be served
	// to clients that request it.
	OCSPStaple []byte
	// SignedCertificateTimestamps contains an optional list of Signed
	// Certificate Timestamps which will be served to clients that request it.
	SignedCertificateTimestamps [][]byte
	// Leaf is the parsed form of the leaf certificate, which may be initialized
	// using x509.ParseCertificate to reduce per-handshake processing. If nil,
	// the leaf certificate will be parsed as needed.
	Leaf *x509.Certificate
}
    A Certificate is a chain of one or more certificates, leaf first.

func LoadX509KeyPair(certFile, keyFile string) (Certificate, error)
    LoadX509KeyPair reads and parses a public/private key pair from a pair of
    files. The files must contain PEM encoded data. The certificate file may
    contain intermediate certificates following the leaf certificate to form a
    certificate chain. On successful return, Certificate.Leaf will be populated.

    Before Go 1.23 Certificate.Leaf was left nil, and the parsed certificate was
    discarded. This behavior can be re-enabled by setting "x509keypairleaf=0" in
    the GODEBUG environment variable.

func X509KeyPair(certPEMBlock, keyPEMBlock []byte) (Certificate, error)
    X509KeyPair parses a public/private key pair from a pair of PEM encoded
    data. On successful return, Certificate.Leaf will be populated.

    Before Go 1.23 Certificate.Leaf was left nil, and the parsed certificate was
    discarded. This behavior can be re-enabled by setting "x509keypairleaf=0" in
    the GODEBUG environment variable.

type CertificateRequestInfo struct {
	// AcceptableCAs contains zero or more, DER-encoded, X.501
	// Distinguished Names. These are the names of root or intermediate CAs
	// that the server wishes the returned certificate to be signed by. An
	// empty slice indicates that the server has no preference.
	AcceptableCAs [][]byte

	// SignatureSchemes lists the signature schemes that the server is
	// willing to verify.
	SignatureSchemes []SignatureScheme

	// Version is the TLS version that was negotiated for this connection.
	Version uint16

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    CertificateRequestInfo contains information from a server's
    CertificateRequest message, which is used to demand a certificate and proof
    of control from a client.

func (c *CertificateRequestInfo) Context() context.Context
    Context returns the context of the handshake that is in progress.
    This context is a child of the context passed to HandshakeContext, if any,
    and is canceled when the handshake concludes.

func (cri *CertificateRequestInfo) SupportsCertificate(c *Certificate) error
    SupportsCertificate returns nil if the provided certificate is supported by
    the server that sent the CertificateRequest. Otherwise, it returns an error
    describing the reason for the incompatibility.

type CertificateVerificationError struct {
	// UnverifiedCertificates and its contents should not be modified.
	UnverifiedCertificates []*x509.Certificate
	Err                    error
}
    CertificateVerificationError is returned when certificate verification fails
    during the handshake.

func (e *CertificateVerificationError) Error() string

func (e *CertificateVerificationError) Unwrap() error

type CipherSuite struct {
	ID   uint16
	Name string

	// Supported versions is the list of TLS protocol versions that can
	// negotiate this cipher suite.
	SupportedVersions []uint16

	// Insecure is true if the cipher suite has known security issues
	// due to its primitives, design, or implementation.
	Insecure bool
}
    CipherSuite is a TLS cipher suite. Note that most functions in this package
    accept and expose cipher suite IDs instead of this type.

func CipherSuites() []*CipherSuite
    CipherSuites returns a list of cipher suites currently implemented by
    this package, excluding those with security issues, which are returned by
    InsecureCipherSuites.

    The list is sorted by ID. Note that the default cipher suites selected by
    this package might depend on logic that can't be captured by a static list,
    and might not match those returned by this function.

func InsecureCipherSuites() []*CipherSuite
    InsecureCipherSuites returns a list of cipher suites currently implemented
    by this package and which have security issues.

    Most applications should not use the cipher suites in this list, and should
    only use those returned by CipherSuites.

type ClientAuthType int
    ClientAuthType declares the policy the server will follow for TLS Client
    Authentication.

const (
	// NoClientCert indicates that no client certificate should be requested
	// during the handshake, and if any certificates are sent they will not
	// be verified.
	NoClientCert ClientAuthType = iota
	// RequestClientCert indicates that a client certificate should be requested
	// during the handshake, but does not require that the client send any
	// certificates.
	RequestClientCert
	// RequireAnyClientCert indicates that a client certificate should be requested
	// during the handshake, and that at least one certificate is required to be
	// sent by the client, but that certificate is not required to be valid.
	RequireAnyClientCert
	// VerifyClientCertIfGiven indicates that a client certificate should be requested
	// during the handshake, but does not require that the client sends a
	// certificate. If the client does send a certificate it is required to be
	// valid.
	VerifyClientCertIfGiven
	// RequireAndVerifyClientCert indicates that a client certificate should be requested
	// during the handshake, and that at least one valid certificate is required
	// to be sent by the client.
	RequireAndVerifyClientCert
)
func (i ClientAuthType) String() string

type ClientHelloInfo struct {
	// CipherSuites lists the CipherSuites supported by the client (e.g.
	// TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256).
	CipherSuites []uint16

	// ServerName indicates the name of the server requested by the client
	// in order to support virtual hosting. ServerName is only set if the
	// client is using SNI (see RFC 4366, Section 3.1).
	ServerName string

	// SupportedCurves lists the key exchange mechanisms supported by the
	// client. It was renamed to "supported groups" in TLS 1.3, see RFC 8446,
	// Section 4.2.7 and [CurveID].
	//
	// SupportedCurves may be nil in TLS 1.2 and lower if the Supported Elliptic
	// Curves Extension is not being used (see RFC 4492, Section 5.1.1).
	SupportedCurves []CurveID

	// SupportedPoints lists the point formats supported by the client.
	// SupportedPoints is set only if the Supported Point Formats Extension
	// is being used (see RFC 4492, Section 5.1.2).
	SupportedPoints []uint8

	// SignatureSchemes lists the signature and hash schemes that the client
	// is willing to verify. SignatureSchemes is set only if the Signature
	// Algorithms Extension is being used (see RFC 5246, Section 7.4.1.4.1).
	SignatureSchemes []SignatureScheme

	// SupportedProtos lists the application protocols supported by the client.
	// SupportedProtos is set only if the Application-Layer Protocol
	// Negotiation Extension is being used (see RFC 7301, Section 3.1).
	//
	// Servers can select a protocol by setting Config.NextProtos in a
	// GetConfigForClient return value.
	SupportedProtos []string

	// SupportedVersions lists the TLS versions supported by the client.
	// For TLS versions less than 1.3, this is extrapolated from the max
	// version advertised by the client, so values other than the greatest
	// might be rejected if used.
	SupportedVersions []uint16

	// Extensions lists the IDs of the extensions presented by the client
	// in the ClientHello.
	Extensions []uint16

	// Conn is the underlying net.Conn for the connection. Do not read
	// from, or write to, this connection; that will cause the TLS
	// connection to fail.
	Conn net.Conn

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ClientHelloInfo contains information from a ClientHello message in order
    to guide application logic in the GetCertificate and GetConfigForClient
    callbacks.

func (c *ClientHelloInfo) Context() context.Context
    Context returns the context of the handshake that is in progress.
    This context is a child of the context passed to HandshakeContext, if any,
    and is canceled when the handshake concludes.

func (chi *ClientHelloInfo) SupportsCertificate(c *Certificate) error
    SupportsCertificate returns nil if the provided certificate is supported
    by the client that sent the ClientHello. Otherwise, it returns an error
    describing the reason for the incompatibility.

    If this ClientHelloInfo was passed to a GetConfigForClient or GetCertificate
    callback, this method will take into account the associated Config.
    Note that if GetConfigForClient returns a different Config, the change can't
    be accounted for by this method.

    This function will call x509.ParseCertificate unless c.Leaf is set, which
    can incur a significant performance cost.

type ClientSessionCache interface {
	// Get searches for a ClientSessionState associated with the given key.
	// On return, ok is true if one was found.
	Get(sessionKey string) (session *ClientSessionState, ok bool)

	// Put adds the ClientSessionState to the cache with the given key. It might
	// get called multiple times in a connection if a TLS 1.3 server provides
	// more than one session ticket. If called with a nil *ClientSessionState,
	// it should remove the cache entry.
	Put(sessionKey string, cs *ClientSessionState)
}
    ClientSessionCache is a cache of ClientSessionState objects that can be used
    by a client to resume a TLS session with a given server. ClientSessionCache
    implementations should expect to be called concurrently from different
    goroutines. Up to TLS 1.2, only ticket-based resumption is supported,
    not SessionID-based resumption. In TLS 1.3 they were merged into PSK modes,
    which are supported via this interface.

func NewLRUClientSessionCache(capacity int) ClientSessionCache
    NewLRUClientSessionCache returns a ClientSessionCache with the given
    capacity that uses an LRU strategy. If capacity is < 1, a default capacity
    is used instead.

type ClientSessionState struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ClientSessionState contains the state needed by a client to resume a
    previous TLS session.

func NewResumptionState(ticket []byte, state *SessionState) (*ClientSessionState, error)
    NewResumptionState returns a state value that can be returned by
    [ClientSessionCache.Get] to resume a previous session.

    state needs to be returned by ParseSessionState, and the ticket and session
    state must have been returned by ClientSessionState.ResumptionState.

func (cs *ClientSessionState) ResumptionState() (ticket []byte, state *SessionState, err error)
    ResumptionState returns the session ticket sent by the server (also known as
    the session's identity) and the state necessary to resume this session.

    It can be called by [ClientSessionCache.Put] to serialize (with
    SessionState.Bytes) and store the session.

type Config struct {
	// Rand provides the source of entropy for nonces and RSA blinding.
	// If Rand is nil, TLS uses the cryptographic random reader in package
	// crypto/rand.
	// The Reader must be safe for use by multiple goroutines.

	// Certificates or GetClientCertificate.
	//
	// Note: if there are multiple Certificates, and they don't have the
	// optional field Leaf set, certificate selection will incur a significant
	// per-handshake performance cost.
	Certificates []Certificate

	// certificate with a given name. Leave this field nil to let the library
	// select the first compatible chain from Certificates.
	NameToCertificate map[string]*Certificate

	// GetCertificate returns a Certificate based on the given
	// ClientHelloInfo. It will only be called if the client supplies SNI
	// information or if Certificates is empty.
	//
	// If GetCertificate is nil or returns nil, then the certificate is
	// retrieved from NameToCertificate. If NameToCertificate is nil, the
	// best element of Certificates will be used.
	//
	// Once a Certificate is returned it should not be modified.
	GetCertificate func(*ClientHelloInfo) (*Certificate, error)

	// GetClientCertificate, if not nil, is called when a server requests a
	// certificate from a client. If set, the contents of Certificates will
	// be ignored.
	//
	// If GetClientCertificate returns an error, the handshake will be
	// aborted and that error will be returned. Otherwise

}
    A Config structure is used to configure a TLS client or server. After one
    has been passed to a TLS function it must not be modified. A Config may be
    reused; the tls package will also not modify it.

func (c *Config) BuildNameToCertificate()
    BuildNameToCertificate parses c.Certificates and builds c.NameToCertificate
    from the CommonName and SubjectAlternateName fields of each of the leaf
    certificates.

    Deprecated: NameToCertificate only allows associating a single certificate
    with a given name. Leave that field nil to let the library select the first
    compatible chain from Certificates.

func (c *Config) Clone() *Config
    Clone returns a shallow clone of c or nil if c is nil. It is safe to clone a
    Config that is being used concurrently by a TLS client or server.

func (c *Config) DecryptTicket(identity []byte, cs ConnectionState) (*SessionState, error)
    DecryptTicket decrypts a ticket encrypted by Config.EncryptTicket. It can be
    used as a [Config.UnwrapSession] implementation.

    If the ticket can't be decrypted or parsed, DecryptTicket returns (nil,
    nil).

func (c *Config) EncryptTicket(cs ConnectionState, ss *SessionState) ([]byte, error)
    EncryptTicket encrypts a ticket with the Config's configured (or
    default) session ticket keys. It can be used as a [Config.WrapSession]
    implementation.

func (c *Config) SetSessionTicketKeys(keys [][32]byte)
    SetSessionTicketKeys updates the session ticket keys for a server.

    The first key will be used when creating new tickets, while all keys can
    be used for decrypting tickets. It is safe to call this function while the
    server is running in order to rotate the session ticket keys. The function
    will panic if keys is empty.

    Calling this function will turn off automatic session ticket key rotation.

    If multiple servers are terminating connections for the same host they
    should all have the same session ticket keys. If the session ticket keys
    leaks, previously recorded and future TLS connections using those keys might
    be compromised.

type Conn struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A Conn represents a secured connection. It implements the net.Conn
    interface.

func Client(conn net.Conn, config *Config) *Conn
    Client returns a new TLS client side connection using conn as the underlying
    transport. The config cannot be nil: users must set either ServerName or
    InsecureSkipVerify in the config.

func Dial(network, addr string, config *Config) (*Conn, error)
    Dial connects to the given network address using net.Dial and then
    initiates a TLS handshake, returning the resulting TLS connection.
    Dial interprets a nil configuration as equivalent to the zero configuration;
    see the documentation of Config for the defaults.

func DialWithDialer(dialer *net.Dialer, network, addr string, config *Config) (*Conn, error)
    DialWithDialer connects to the given network address using dialer.Dial and
    then initiates a TLS handshake, returning the resulting TLS connection.
    Any timeout or deadline given in the dialer apply to connection and TLS
    handshake as a whole.

    DialWithDialer interprets a nil configuration as equivalent to the zero
    configuration; see the documentation of Config for the defaults.

    DialWithDialer uses context.Background internally; to specify the context,
    use Dialer.DialContext with NetDialer set to the desired dialer.

func Server(conn net.Conn, config *Config) *Conn
    Server returns a new TLS server side connection using conn as the underlying
    transport. The configuration config must be non-nil and must include at
    least one certificate or else set GetCertificate.

func (c *Conn) Close() error
    Close closes the connection.

func (c *Conn) CloseWrite() error
    CloseWrite shuts down the writing side of the connection. It should only be
    called once the handshake has completed and does not call CloseWrite on the
    underlying connection. Most callers should just use Conn.Close.

func (c *Conn) ConnectionState() ConnectionState
    ConnectionState returns basic TLS details about the connection.

func (c *Conn) Handshake() error
    Handshake runs the client or server handshake protocol if it has not yet
    been run.

    Most uses of this package need not call Handshake explicitly: the first
    Conn.Read or Conn.Write will call it automatically.

    For control over canceling or setting a timeout on a handshake, use
    Conn.HandshakeContext or the Dialer's DialContext method instead.

    In order to avoid denial of service attacks, the maximum RSA key size
    allowed in certificates sent by either the TLS server or client is limited
    to 8192 bits. This limit can be overridden by setting tlsmaxrsasize in the
    GODEBUG environment variable (e.g. GODEBUG=tlsmaxrsasize=4096).

func (c *Conn) HandshakeContext(ctx context.Context) error
    HandshakeContext runs the client or server handshake protocol if it has not
    yet been run.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context is canceled before
    the handshake is complete, the handshake is interrupted and an error is
    returned. Once the handshake has completed, cancellation of the context will
    not affect the connection.

    Most uses of this package need not call HandshakeContext explicitly:
    the first Conn.Read or Conn.Write will call it automatically.

func (c *Conn) LocalAddr() net.Addr
    LocalAddr returns the local network address.

func (c *Conn) NetConn() net.Conn
    NetConn returns the underlying connection that is wrapped by c. Note that
    writing to or reading from this connection directly will corrupt the TLS
    session.

func (c *Conn) OCSPResponse() []byte
    OCSPResponse returns the stapled OCSP response from the TLS server, if any.
    (Only valid for client connections.)

func (c *Conn) Read(b []byte) (int, error)
    Read reads data from the connection.

    As Read calls Conn.Handshake, in order to prevent indefinite blocking
    a deadline must be set for both Read and Conn.Write before Read is
    called when the handshake has not yet completed. See Conn.SetDeadline,
    Conn.SetReadDeadline, and Conn.SetWriteDeadline.

func (c *Conn) RemoteAddr() net.Addr
    RemoteAddr returns the remote network address.

func (c *Conn) SetDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetDeadline sets the read and write deadlines associated with the
    connection. A zero value for t means Conn.Read and Conn.Write will not time
    out. After a Write has timed out, the TLS state is corrupt and all future
    writes will return the same error.

func (c *Conn) SetReadDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetReadDeadline sets the read deadline on the underlying connection.
    A zero value for t means Conn.Read will not time out.

func (c *Conn) SetWriteDeadline(t time.Time) error
    SetWriteDeadline sets the write deadline on the underlying connection.
    A zero value for t means Conn.Write will not time out. After a Conn.Write
    has timed out, the TLS state is corrupt and all future writes will return
    the same error.

func (c *Conn) VerifyHostname(host string) error
    VerifyHostname checks that the peer certificate chain is valid for
    connecting to host. If so, it returns nil; if not, it returns an error
    describing the problem.

func (c *Conn) Write(b []byte) (int, error)
    Write writes data to the connection.

    As Write calls Conn.Handshake, in order to prevent indefinite blocking
    a deadline must be set for both Conn.Read and Write before Write is
    called when the handshake has not yet completed. See Conn.SetDeadline,
    Conn.SetReadDeadline, and Conn.SetWriteDeadline.

	ECHAccepted bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    ConnectionState records basic TLS details about the connection.

func (cs *ConnectionState) ExportKeyingMaterial(label string, context []byte, length int) ([]byte, error)
    ExportKeyingMaterial returns length bytes of exported key material in a
    new slice as defined in RFC 5705. If context is nil, it is not used as
    part of the seed. If the connection was set to allow renegotiation via
    Config.Renegotiation, or if the connections supports neither TLS 1.3 nor
    Extended Master Secret, this function will return an error.

    Exporting key material without Extended Master Secret or TLS 1.3 was
    disabled in Go 1.22 due to security issues (see the Security Considerations
    sections of RFC 5705 and RFC 7627), but can be re-enabled with the GODEBUG
    setting tlsunsafeekm=1.

type CurveID uint16
    CurveID is the type of a TLS identifier for a key exchange mechanism. See
    https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xml#tls-parameters-8.

    In TLS 1.2, this registry used to support only elliptic curves. In TLS 1.3,
    it was extended to other groups and renamed NamedGroup. See RFC 8446,
    Section 4.2.7. It was then also extended to other mechanisms, such as hybrid
    post-quantum KEMs.

    Dialer dials TLS connections given a configuration and a Dialer for the
    underlying connection.

func (d *Dialer) Dial(network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)
    Dial connects to the given network address and initiates a TLS handshake,
    returning the resulting TLS connection.

    The returned Conn, if any, will always be of type *Conn.

    Dial uses context.Background internally; to specify the context, use
    Dialer.DialContext.

func (d *Dialer) DialContext(ctx context.Context, network, addr string) (net.Conn, error)
    DialContext connects to the given network address and initiates a TLS
    handshake, returning the resulting TLS connection.

    The provided Context must be non-nil. If the context expires before the
    connection is complete, an error is returned. Once successfully connected,
    any expiration of the context will not affect the connection.

    The returned Conn, if any, will always be of type *Conn.

type ECHRejectionError struct {
	RetryConfigList []byte
}
    ECHRejectionError is the error type returned when ECH is rejected by a
    remote server. If the server offered a ECHConfigList to use for retries,
    the RetryConfigList field will contain this list.

    The client may treat an ECHRejectionError with an empty set of RetryConfigs
    as a secure signal from the server.

type RenegotiationSupport int
    RenegotiationSupport enumerates the different levels of support for TLS
    renegotiation. TLS renegotiation is the act of performing subsequent
    handshakes on a connection after the first. This significantly complicates
    the state machine and has been the source of numerous, subtle security
    issues. Initiating a renegotiation is not supported, but support for
    accepting renegotiation requests may be enabled.

    Even when enabled, the server may not change its identity between handshakes
    (i.e. the leaf certificate must be the same). Additionally, concurrent
    handshake and application data flow is not permitted so renegotiation
    can only be used with protocols that synchronise with the renegotiation,
    such as HTTPS.

    Renegotiation is not defined in TLS 1.3.

const (
	// RenegotiateNever disables renegotiation.
	RenegotiateNever RenegotiationSupport = iota

	// RenegotiateOnceAsClient allows a remote server to request
	// renegotiation once per connection.
	RenegotiateOnceAsClient

	// RenegotiateFreelyAsClient allows a remote server to repeatedly
	// request renegotiation.
	RenegotiateFreelyAsClient

type SessionState struct {

	// Extra is ignored by crypto/tls, but is encoded by [SessionState.Bytes]
	// and parsed by [ParseSessionState].
	//
	// This allows [Config.UnwrapSession]/[Config.WrapSession] and
	// [ClientSessionCache] implementations to store and retrieve additional
	// data alongside this session.
	//
	// To allow different layers in a protocol stack to share this field,
	// applications must only append to it, not replace it, and must use entries
	// that can be recognized even if out of order (for example, by starting
	// with an id and version prefix).
	Extra [][]byte

	// EarlyData indicates whether the ticket can be used for 0-RTT in a QUIC
	// connection. The application may set this to false if it is true to
	// decline to offer 0-RTT even if supported.
	EarlyData bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    A SessionState is a resumable session.

func ParseSessionState(data []byte) (*SessionState, error)
    ParseSessionState parses a SessionState encoded by SessionState.Bytes.

func (s *SessionState) Bytes() ([]byte, error)
    Bytes encodes the session, including any private fields, so that it can be
    parsed by ParseSessionState. The encoding contains secret values critical to
    the security of future and possibly past sessions.

    The specific encoding should be considered opaque and may change
    incompatibly between Go versions.

type SignatureScheme uint16
    SignatureScheme identifies a signature algorithm supported by TLS. See RFC
    8446, Section 4.2.3.

const (
	// RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms.
	PKCS1WithSHA256 SignatureScheme = 0x0401
	PKCS1WithSHA384 SignatureScheme = 0x0501
	PKCS1WithSHA512 SignatureScheme = 0x0601

	// RSASSA-PSS algorithms with public key OID rsaEncryption.
	PSSWithSHA256 SignatureScheme = 0x0804
	PSSWithSHA384 SignatureScheme = 0x0805
	PSSWithSHA512 SignatureScheme = 0x0806

	// ECDSA algorithms. Only constrained to a specific curve in TLS 1.3.
	ECDSAWithP256AndSHA256 SignatureScheme = 0x0403
	ECDSAWithP384AndSHA384 SignatureScheme = 0x0503
	ECDSAWithP521AndSHA512 SignatureScheme = 0x0603

	// EdDSA algorithms.
	Ed25519 SignatureScheme = 0x0807

	// Legacy signature and hash algorithms for TLS 1.2.
	PKCS1WithSHA1 SignatureScheme = 0x0201
	ECDSAWithSHA1 SignatureScheme = 0x0203
)
func (i SignatureScheme) String() string


BUG: The crypto/tls package only implements some countermeasures
against Lucky13 attacks on CBC-mode encryption, and only on SHA1
variants. See http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf and
